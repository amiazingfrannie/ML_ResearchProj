I was having an absolutely awful week,  death of a friend last week (due to suicidal alcohol abuse), other personal issues, and today I had a car accident that destroyed my car. I was feeling absolutely devastated emotionally, and wanted just one positive thing to happen. Then I came across your post and it made me feel so much lighter. This is the type of wholesomeness I was craving. So thank you for sharing your story, I am glad you are fighting for yourself. You gave me the hope and strength that I was struggling to find.

[deleted],"Might have been god, or might have been the nature of people to cheer each other up independently from any plan. I personally think the latter is way more meaningful actually, because it means that the world still is so filled with people looking out for each other that these things happen! If it was all planned don't you think that undermines the fact that the old man could have just as well chosen not to do what he did?

I see this as proof that the world is a good place (sometimes) because people choose to look out for each other and not that there is an allmighty being looking out for people.",2023-01-14 06:08:26,10bbq3d
Erinn_13,"This made me tear up reading it. Those moments feel so much bigger than us. 

My mom has a similar story. In her early 20‚Äôs she was chronically suicidal. She finally decided she was going to do it. She bought razor blades and drew a hot bath. As she was getting ready to settle in and follow through there was a knock on her door. It was her roommate‚Äôs father. He wasn‚Äôt scheduled to show up.
I‚Äôm fact he lived two hours away. He ultimately and unknowingly saved her life.  She too believes it was one of those ‚Äúgod moments‚Äù. 

The world needed her and needs you. I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre here and shared this story. Your journey isn‚Äôt done. I have no doubt this post has a huge impact on someone who is struggling. I wish you all the best. Sending lots of love and light your way.",2023-01-14 10:43:41,10bbq3d

panawayne,"As much as i do acknowledge the sentiment and good will, truth is, that you will not be thinking about them every day. And you don't really know their worth. I know it sounds quite blunt and harsh, but this is just a more ""innocent form"" of sugarcoating things for the sake of the ""good deed"".  I am glad that OP had a positive outcome out of this, but starting from 5 minutes from now, everyone will revert back to their thoughts, their lives, prioritising their shortcomings, etc.  


Unfortunately, you are alone. You and the selected few that might care indeed. Anything else, is a pleasent encounter that happens from time to time, it has a temporary positive impact, and of course is welcomed.   


What i mean is, for instance, if someone is depressed because they are extremely short and it affects them, you cannot go and tell them "" Nooo, you are tall, stop thinking about it""

I recommend you look deep and understand your own mortality. Live your life and treat things as preciously as you can. Try to forgive everyone and be at peace...

RipeAvocadoLapdance,"A few things:

1. I'm sorry you saw that and I'm sorry your mother is invalidating your feelings. Sounds like she's gotten hurt before and has closed herself up from emotions to cope.

2. Your reaction is normal after seeing something traumatic. I really recommend talking with a professional ASAP to process the event. I believe trauma sticks within our body, literally, if we don't metabolize it. For example: someone who goes through a traumatic physical experience (violence, SA etc) may experience body pain later in life due to the trauma literally leaving emotional scars. 

3. I've seen some pretty crazy things too, and unfortunately they do stick with your quite a bit, but it will lessen over time.

Dilettante-Dave,"Look man there is zero shame for feeling strongly over the death of a fellow human being (or other animal imo). This is a healthy response. I'm sorry you had to experience that. Wishing to save them even though you know you can't is normal. It's a shitty thing man. People who don't experience this kind of response is often because they have experienced so much of this they are desensitized or numb. And the other likely experience cognitive dissonance. They can't put themselves in that place.

There's a reason the military works hard to desensitize troops, its a lot harder to do your job when you're constantly empathizing with the enemy. It's why many US cops have no problem plugging people. They unfortunately receive much of the same training. Everyone should react as you did. Maybe one day we'll get there instead of dehumanizing others and encouraging more violent acts. 

If you can, I would make an appointment with a therapist or someone who can help you process this. I read once a theory that ptsd often manifests in troops bc western society covers up the pain and difficulties. They react as your mum did and troops carry on cuz that's what they know. But it all has to be processed somehow. If you bury it, it might resurface in other ways. A ritual perhaps to acknowledge their passing or the event. Imo communal rites and rituals have enormous power to empower and shoulder life's shit. 

When Yazidi women came back into their community after being sex slaves in ISIS, a new ritual of cleansing was created. My heart hurts for them, that they went through such things I can't imagine. I don't know any Yazidi women, I didn't even know they existed until ISIS began their genocide. But I like to think that ritual helped them, to know that their community loved them, welcomed them and acknowledged their collective pain.",2023-04-30 23:48:44,1347s6u

FitRefrigerator7256,"You‚Äôre a good human to care. And to cry for this is legit. Don‚Äôt doubt that. If you didn‚Äôt cry or think about it you would essentially be psychotic or completely cut off in a state of no empathy.  Others didn‚Äôt experience what you did and their reaction may have been to turn off completely but that‚Äôs not what you need to do. 

What‚Äôs next is to process the shock of what happened otherwise your brain won‚Äôt be able to rest. Cry if you feel the impulse, it‚Äôs your body doing it‚Äôs job. If you feel like you want to pray for the kid or write the kid a letter and burn it, or if you feel like you need to tell someone to have this make sense in your mind, it‚Äôs ok to do that. 

One thing I‚Äôll recommend having been highly traumatized before is giving your brain the chance to put the sequence together. When things happen so fast, the brain doesn‚Äôt know what to do with the information. 

‚ÄúWtf just happened? Why? Could that have been me or my family? Why is the world this way? Am I still in danger?‚Äù

The mind will loop until it puts the sequence of events together. So, talk w someone trusted or just write this out on paper. 

First I was‚Ä¶
Then I saw‚Ä¶
Then this happened‚Ä¶
Then I went to the _ and did _‚Ä¶

Write out or speak out what happened before during and after. Start with what felt normal before and what went back to normal after and you‚Äôll give your brain a chance to sequence things and rest. Otherwise it‚Äôll stay on high alert. Repeat this as many days as you need to until it sinks in. 

I‚Äôm sorry you experienced this and I‚Äôm sorry for the kid and his loved ones. It is sad and deserves a thoughtful and caring human response.",2023-05-01 04:21:14,1347s6u
BubbaJ34,"Please, please, please, don't listen to your mother. It is perfectly acceptable to mourn a stranger, and definitely a death you bore witness to. In my experience, ""toughen up"" and ""you didn't know him/her/them"" are simply what's said by people who don't know how to process their own feelings, or were taught not to. Compassion is a good thing, and I know this because I've been the unfortunate soul to bear witness to many deaths in many different ways. It's my job to do so (I'm a Paramedic), yes, but nevertheless it hurts.

Please don't let people tell you how to feel. Feel what you feel, grieve if you need to, it's a part of it. Most of all, please don't lose that compassion. As someone who has seen the effects of compassion fatigue in my colleagues (and trust me, it affects every aspect of life), it's not a good place to be. I know you don't know me, but I'm here if you need an ear. I'm sorry you had to see that. Being a grief mop certainly isn't fun.",2023-05-01 05:38:37,1347s6u

adhd_as_fuck,"I saw something similar (traumatic accident, guy's leg was severed at the knee though he was still alive).

The first week or two I was really shaken, and no one around me , probably not me either, seemed to understand how much it affected me. I'd say it took 6-8 weeks before I stopped thinking of it daily but still with a lot of frequency.

It's not weird. We're social animals. We care about other people. And seeing harm or even death is both an existential reminder of our own fragility AND causes us to go into an instinctive survival mode because our lizard brains now worry we too could be in danger. 

Take care of yourself. Therapy would help, even if it's a short course. And if others don't understand, have the grace to recognize they just don't know yet and the kindness to hope its easier for them when they do.",2023-05-01 01:01:18,1347s6u

bluskywanderer,"Two things:

1) I believe that you're suffering from PTSD. You just witnessed a violent death in front of you. It's something people who have had to live through war witness, and it is heavily traumatizing.

A) Do you have access to therapy and counselling? I think you need some soon to help you process the violence you just witnessed.

B) Speak to your manager at work. HR might be ble to often some form of support or possibly offer some compassionate leave.


2) I have a sociopathic mother as well. She is too involved in her own needs she does not understand another person's perspective. Similarly, when she has done something wrong and I call her out on it, she claims it should just remain 'in the past"". But of course that is not true because she never recognized the fault of her actions, so how can it be placed in the past when the past was never addressed?

This ties to the need for therapy, but OP, you need to recognize your mom's sociopathic approach to fulfilling her needs over your emotional well-being. It might not necessarily help make her a better person, but it can help protect you from the emotional damage it causes everytime she acts that way, simply by recognizing unreasonable statements she makes, thereby reducing the impact those callous words have on you.",2023-05-01 07:53:56,1347s6u

Proudlymediocre,"It‚Äôs the worst to see someone die, especially a young person so suddenly. It takes time for the shock to wear off, and then it‚Äôs like a scar that feels okay most of the time then hits you out of the blue for a little bit again. You‚Äôre doing the right things ‚Äî allowing yourself to feel pain, processing it, writing about it. I also go the extra mile to be kind to other (living) strangers for awhile ‚Äî this always helps my spirit and takes my mind off my pain.

Samuel Fuller was a successful indie film maker in the 1950s and 1960s who saw the worst there is to see as a combat troop in World War 2. In his autobiography, he wrote about the depression and shock he felt returning form battle, how no one ‚Äî including his mom ‚Äî could truly understand his pain, how it took him a full year to get out of bed when he returned. I take strange solace in that chapter because it reminds me that the debilitating pain we feel sometimes is real, because even an energetic and successful person like Fuller had difficulty getting out of bed after experiencing trauma.

ThE_pLaAaGuE,"The mother‚Äôs reaction is normal and not overly sensitive. However, she should take into consideration people‚Äôs differences. Some people care about other people more than she does. Perhaps she was incapable.

Btw OP‚Äôs reaction is also normal. Some people are better at understanding other people, and can understand emotions better.

Edit: she could also have told you to toughen up because she cares about your long term emotional well-being. I don‚Äôt know, I can‚Äôt read minds.

BreathOfPepperAir,"Hey OP, I just want to add that your mom is teaching you that traumatic incidences are not important. She's wrong and clearly doesn't have any empathy. It is 100% normal to be traumatised by what happened.

Most people will need counselling after seeing someone die, that's how serious this is. Ignore your mom, there's something wrong with her.

AlSO, you could try playing Tetris, as in the game. Playing tetris apparently helps you process trauma and can reduce the symptoms of PTSD.",2023-05-01 00:48:16,1347s6u
Bored_dane,"Not at all. Your mother on the other hand was underreacting. I didn't know untill reading this comment that you're a guy. Maybe it's some wierd idea that men can't have feelings or shouldn't show it? Or she is severly desensitized from past experiences? 

Didn't you and the other passengers recieve trauma counselling? If I had experienced anything like that, I'd be fucked up for quite some time. 

Did you read any news about it? Where did it happen? I hope by some miracle that he survived and not turning on the sirens was a mistake or something. Maybe knowing what happened to him will help you move forward.

We did manage to get his heart beating again and delivered him to the paramedics breathing and muttering words.

Fritochipteeth,"I‚Äôm so sorry about losing your partner to suicide, and finding the body. I recently lost a good friend to suicide too, and it triggered my suicidality tenfold bc her and I were VERY similar. Something in my head is saying‚Äî well then, suicide is my destiny I guess. Her boyfriend is my bestfriend too, we actually all met in a partial hospitalization program..

This must‚Äôve felt like the final nail in the coffin, and I don‚Äôt blame you for feeling that way especially if you have already been battling suicidality for as long as you have. It‚Äôs kind of impossible even imagining there is a life worth living, we can all tell you this here, but it‚Äôs damn near impossible to believe.

I too am kind of in the state where I‚Äôve lost my smile, it is very hard for me to even crack a smile, I just can‚Äôt really at this point. I don‚Äôt know what keeps me going, I guess I have a vision for greatness in the future. 
I know life is excruciating at this point, and you‚Äôre probably kind of wondering what even is the point of continuing work, or any professional goal when you feel you‚Äôre at the end of your rope‚Äî like what is the purpose of all of this? 

As tough as it is, I‚Äôm proud of you, me and anyone else who has the cojones to post about our health‚Äî I guess something, somewhere in you IS concerned, right? Though it‚Äôs hard to believe. Something makes you want to post and ask for help. I think that‚Äôs step 1 to coming back to life. It‚Äôs a slow and long process, but I‚Äôm learning that honestly a lot of times it‚Äôs not all in my head and just avenues to my brain chemistry‚Äî there are some avenues, some important avenues of my life that REALLY suck. My social life sucks, my physical health sucks, my professional life sucks‚Äî and I‚Äôm not catastrophizing, they really fuckin do. depression is a catch 22, and god damn is it hard to break out of. But it‚Äôs possible.

I pray that in this moment of extreme intensity you take the positive side of this rage and say ‚Äúfuck it I‚Äôm not living like this anymore.‚Äù I think it‚Äôs important we kill THIS version of ourselves and basically have an ego death. We‚Äôve been living wrong and I don‚Äôt blame us. Depression has grabbed us in a choke hold‚Äî but there is hope bc you‚Äôre posting.

golhan64,"Depression is tough‚Ä¶ try and fight through it even when it feels like theres no hope. I feel like that many days on and off. Ive never really been professionally diagnosed with depression but i know i have it. Negative thoughts creep on me all the time. I feel like people wont care but trust‚Ä¶ those you think dont care actually do. No one wants to hear that someone they knew is no longer with us. Yes you are a part of us even if we are complete strangers. My experiences with depression sucked. Others i know who have suffered in some form makes it suck for me knowing they dealing with it also. I know some that are no longer with us because of it and wish we could have gone through things together. I cope with music‚Ä¶. Something that relates to tour mood and then something can uplifts you. Please fight through it. I feel for you. Life is finding peace and balance with all that it offers, good and bad. Animal companions definitely help. Their need for your care. That gives purpose. Im in no way a professional and i find that a professional may not be as helpful as one would think/suggest. They are not going through what you are. Only studying the matter. What can help is telling yourself out loud that you are needed, loved, and most of all matter even if you feel and think you dont. Mental health is not understood by so many. I have suffered and endured all alone and fought through and continue to do so. It gets severe at times and i break down and just start crying. It helps to just let it out and cry sometimes its ok. Doesnt matter who judges you. Only person that can is the entity we all call as a higher power. Im not as religious as most people are but do believe there are higher beings out there. There could be some kind of creator of human life form. But not getting into religion or beliefs just saying dont let other humans judge you because they dont have the understanding to be able to. Find something that you can get into that will keep you occupied that interests you even if its a slight interest. Surround yourself with positivity. Just know that others are in your shows and are fighting through and hanging in there. If i can continue to fight through and keep searching for the purpose so can you.

therapysword,"I'm so sorry for your loss. I know that's all we can say as strangers on the internet, but I mean it.

I also mean it when I say that everyone deserves a chance at life, including you. I want to make it clear that I'm not singling you out and trying to logic you into suddenly valuing your own life - I've been there, I know it's not that simple. What I can suggest is treating yourself like you'd treat someone else in this situation. Dissociate yourself from your body just enough to take care of it like one of your pets. Keep it healthy if you can while you're in this period, or whatever you can do. 

Buy yourself a bit more time, in the meantime. Nobody ever makes good decisions when they're in the dark pits of grief and emptiness. NOBODY. Call your family if you can. Let them know how you're doing - or don't. Just talk to them. If they try and make plans, say yes. Even if you don't think you'll make them right now. 

I believe you can survive this, and I'm not kidding myself or you, because there's no proof you can't make it through this. You have a running steak of livelihood since the day you were born. You can keep it going. There's nothing physically different about you that makes you different from them, and there's no threshold of a ""good reason"" to live either. It can be petty, or ruthless, or even sad. Scrape on by the skin of your teeth and let the anger keep you going. Even if it's one thing that keeps you alive, like keeping your pets or talking to someone you care about, that's enough.

And for what it's worth, even if it's not the same care of someone who knows you IRL, reading this and becoming aware of your existence has made me care about you and your survival. I really do wish you the best. I hope one day I can hear a new story or see a new post from you.",2023-04-26 16:37:25,12z5qmh

Alarmed_Ability7656,"Man this hits too close to home. 

I'm so sorry to hear about everything you're going through. It sounds like you're struggling with a lot of pain and grief right now. I understand how it feels to carry the weight of past traumas and to feel like a broken shell of a person but you're not defective or broken in any way. You're a human being who has gone through a lot of difficult experiences, and it's understandable that you're struggling right now. It takes immense courage to open up about these kinds of things, and I want to acknowledge that. I want you to know that everything you've said and done is completely valid. 

I can really relate to what you've shared. Like you, I've experienced a lot of trauma and loss in my life, and I've struggled with my mental health as a result. When I was young, I was abused by parents and it left me with a lot of trauma, depression, PTSD, and anxiety. I had to move around a lot and was always the new kid in school as well. This made it really hard for me to build connections with people, and it made me feel like a mess of a person.

Things got even worse when I lost my best friend who was my whole world. My only friend. So I get you, losing someone that important you is one of the most devastating things a person can go through, and it can be hard to adjust to life without your SO. It's understandable to feel angry and alone when it seems like nobody else understands or cares what you're going through. FUCK YOUR BOSS. 

I‚Äôve abused drugs and alcohol to cope with everything since the age of 16. So I won't give you advice on substance abuse because I have been there before. In fact, there was a time when it saved my life as a form of escapism that provided relief. It's not a healthy coping mechanism, but sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going when we are hanging on by a thread.

I hit a really low point about four years ago and came very close to ending my life.

Thankfully, I was able to get help and I decided to take things day by day, hour by hour. It was a constant struggle to fight my internal demons, but I managed to keep going.

Slowly but surely, things started to improve. I worked hard and became a nurse practitioner, which helped me to earn a good income and start building a better life for myself. I never thought that would be possible just four years ago. Although life isn't perfect and I still struggle with depression and anxiety, I believe that I'm headed in the right direction. I hold onto the hope that one day things will improve. 

I want you to know that you're not alone in feeling overwhelmed and like things will never get better. 

For now try to take things one day at a time and continue pushing forward. I know that it may sound presumptuous and naive for me to say this, but I truly believe that you can overcome this. I will pray for you overcome this. 

I really wish you all the love, happiness, and strength in the world. If you ever need someone to talk to or some support, please don't hesitate to pm me.",2023-04-27 00:15:56,12z5qmh
captainsparkl3pants,"I'm so sorry for what you're going through. To help, the things below are things that have helped me get better - at least manage my life when things are particularly bad. I hope they help you too.

1) talk to your doctor - even if crying in their office is embarrassing, even a family doc can get you started on a low-level, non-therapeutic dose of a med that can help depression and give you a referral to a psychiatrist office. This is worth the money.

2) find a grief or suicide support group or even a counselor just to talk to, 

3) do ONE thing each day to take care of yourself, 

4) any kind of drinking or drugs is making this worse (trust me, been through some stuff and drank myself to sleep on the weekends for a time), as it messes with fun stuff like hormones and brain chemistry, 

5) some days, you just have to CHOOSE to drag yourself out of bed and try to function as best you can, and schedule time once a week to feel shitty and sorry for yourself.

6) you are not alone, even if you feel like you are, 

7) take this from a person with a few different mental and hormonal issues who has struggled with suicidal thoughts since my teen years: You can do life, and you matter. You are worthwhile, and you can get through this.

8) get a hobby and/or a pet - it will give you a purpose and reason to keep going.

9) do something nice for others - this will give your life some meaning

10) listen to positive, motivational, uplifting stuff - music, podcasts, books, meditations - this will help. Also if you like fiction, just reading or listening to a book will distract you long enough to pull your mind away from your problems.

11) nature is helpful. If there is a park, and It's nice out, go for a walk. Plus, sunshine and exercise is helpful for mood boosting.

12) give yourself compassion and loving kindness. Put your hand on your heart, feel it beat, and send feelings of kindness and compassion to yourself.

mh0102921,"I understand, and you‚Äôre right. Those kinds of strategies would be better for you once youve come out of this state of grief, but probably not going to be very effective when you‚Äôre in the midst of it all. If you can try to get to a psychiatrist, they can prescribe you some medication that may help to quiet the suicidal thoughts/ideations you‚Äôre experiencing AND at the same time help to combat the alcohol/drug cravings that you‚Äôre \*understandably\* having. Your brain is struggling to comprehend a horrific traumatic event, and it‚Äôs \*desperately\* looking for an escape. This is not crazy, or irrational of you. Not to mention you already expressed your own history with suicidal tendencies, and thats going to make it all the more difficult to manage. You deserve help and relief.

And again, you are right. I was having severe suicidal thoughts and went through a bit of a psychotic break back in 2021. On top of my own shit of going through a mixed episode, I was trying to keep my brother alive who was on his own suicidal mission. He's a type 1 diabetic and severe alcoholic, and had been willingly going into ketoacidosis once a month for a year, saw him on his death bed too many times than I can count, and I just lost it. No amount of deep breathing or coping skills was going to help me. I ended up emailing my psychiatric nurse in the middle of a particularly dangerous night, she ended up putting me on seroquel that morning, and it silenced all the suicidal thoughts for a good while until I could think clearly again. It was helpful for just keeping me alive while my brain processed all the shit I should never have witnessed.

You should never have witnessed what you saw and had to deal with. This is likely trauma that you‚Äôre dealing with. If you can get to a psychiatrist or even go for a psychiatric stay at a hospital, I really really think you should consider it. Your brain is desperately trying to process a horrific event, please don‚Äòt do it on your own. You dont have to. You deserve help. I say this out of pure concern for you. I hope you can have this concern for yourself.

I understand that with your partner passing from suicide, somebody who was a part of your soul that that must‚Äôve really messed with your head in regard to your own existence. 

Life is a huge *butterfly effect*, and a LOT of my life I‚Äôve self sabotaged. This is why I am where I am. Somewhere I thought that that behavior was protecting me/helping me get in touch with my true emotions. Like today for example, I‚Äôm fucking SLEEPY. But I have a quiz at 4. I could sleep in my car for hours like I always do‚Äî but then I‚Äôll miss studying for my quiz, end up with a D on the quiz, and my already low self esteem will go cripplingly low. As a result of that possible outcome, my mood will go from a standard 3.5 to a 3. Am I more likely to be a 5 tomorrow? Not really.
Versus if I CHOOSE to study, and don‚Äôt take a nap, let‚Äôs say I end up with a B+ on the quiz‚Äî my mood will go from the standard 3.5 to a 4. Am I more likely to be a 5 tomorrow?  A bit more, especially in comparison to the 3.

I‚Äôm trying to be a bit more mindful on the butterfly effect and how in the long run, slightly more difficult ‚Äúannoying‚Äù choices will lead to my healing. We are in an equilibrium and we stay in that equilibrium. Which is why I don‚Äôt blame any of us with clinical depression. We‚Äôve probably been a 2-4 on the mood scale for a LOOOOONG time. That shit wears on us‚Ä¶.. who wouldn‚Äôt it destroy? How many days of suffering can we go through? For us with clinical depression, THOUSANDS.

While our chemistry sabotages us, a HUGE make or break in our healing is our nurture/our lifestyle choices. It is a BIG chunk of depression.

And Reddit is so anonymous. Since I‚Äôve heard about this, though I‚Äôve never been that bothered by the posts, if it‚Äôs not a good day, I scroll past - I look at it differently. The people replying helpful things could be saving someone‚Äôs life, changing perspective and saving those around them from the sheer devastation suicide can cause. 

Mental health care isn‚Äôt at its best. I‚Äôm in the UK, my first attempt no one notice or knew‚Ä¶ my second, I was pregnant, I called an ambulance right before attempting because the guilt on my baby was all consuming. I was put into a psych ward and I am honestly traumatised from it. When voicing I was going to attempt years ago I was given strong sleeping pills from crisis teams and discharged. When talking to suicide hotlines they were script like.

After two weeks, I just left those because it's trigerrig for me, toxic and frankly unhelpful.

Like I'm not a therapist and if people just keep vomiting their emotional crap online while clearly not looking for any legitimate advice, you realize they are really just fetishizing their own emotions/disease.

It gets boring very, very quickly.

ImHidingBehindANick,"I feel like most people who gravitate towards this kind of sub are in need of help; I doubt many people go out of their way to search for souls in need and in pain. Given the stigma around mental health that is fortunately less intense than 10 years ago (at least where I live) but still prevalent, it's likely that turning to help sources is done after a long time of 'sucking it up' and 'toughing it out'.

If what I said before stands, then there's always going to be a disparity in those who help and those who cry out for help, and among the latter, there will be fewer who tackle arising/lighter issues than those who already have problems dealing with heavier/longer lasting ones. Not to mention that it's hard to help anyone when your headspace is cluttered by negativity, worries and suffering. It's likely why many feel like you, OP, and why many post more than they comment and even then would rather share their experience and be listened to. Of course, I don't mean to generalize, it's just something I noticed looking around, as well as in myself, so feel free to debate it, especially if you have evidence.

Reddit isn't therapy, and us redditors aren't all trained professionals. Some try their best, others just can't deal with stuff, some look for reaffirmation, others need a hand and don't know who to turn to. Some are trapped in a spiral, while others need to vent and understand that most things are temporary and that 'this too shall pass'. However, we're just a group. A group of people sharing something, in this case an interest on one's mental health, our own issues and our understanding of our psyche's importance and fragility. It's not our fellow redditors' responsibility to help us, nor should we expect them to be able to. But perhaps, if we share what we have inside, we might be able to find help from someone half across the world, and we should do the same when and if we can.

d3athgrl,"Putting rules to avoid that type of stuff is going to lead to people literally killing themselves. Being suicidal is EXTREMELY isolating and there are very very few places on the entire internet where talking about it is allowed. Isolating those people more and giving them nowhere to go is gonna make it way worse on a lot of people.

What they should do is just enforce a clear tag for it or something.",2023-01-03 05:44:18,10126hf

BrokenMeatRobot,"Same with r/cptsd. It started becoming a second ""raised by narcissists"";even though use of the RBN lingo was forbidden. Also the amount of people who suffer with cptsd from childhood silences people who have it from other causes, because it appears as if C means ""Childhood"" not ""Complex"". Not enough questions asking how to cope with symptoms, just questions complaining that they have to deal with it, which is valid, but when you don't see any progress and that's all you see? It sucks you right in and you start feeling the same as they do and it makes you feel worse.

PTSD was also a sub that caused me to spiral. It used to be a resource, but complaint posts overwhelm the subreddit so that no actual help or resource post get upvoted to the extent of complaints.  Many people struggling and venting about a lot of the same issues can do that, though. There's not many places people can go for help so they go where they can.

Thankfully there's self help subs like r/CPTSDNextSteps for those wanting to support eachother through the journey of self help healing, but again, user moderated can have its issues and without the guidance of a professional. Because it's all just regular people volunteering to help people who are struggling, they themselves often have to struggle more to keep up with the demand of helping others through what they are going through, and sometimes those places die as people realize it's taking too much energy out of them.

Mental health needs to be a part of healthcare, and healthcare needs to be publicly available to everyone for that reason. Because healthcare is still a privilege in many places in the world, I do believe people deserve a space to vent and usually these subs are the first places people go when they need help, but I don't think a user moderated subreddit can keep up with the amount of people facing crisises.",2023-01-02 15:04:55,10126hf

It always pisses me off when people take down or moderate suicidal comments, out of all things and, for all you know, that may have been their last post that YOU hid from people that could have helped them, possibly their family or authorities. I know that‚Äòs a stretch for Reddit but it strikes me as VERY immoral.

Make a tag to censor or warn about it but, for the love of God, don‚Äòt censor something like this. People don‚Äòt realise that this creates more harm than any ‚Äûgood‚Äú. All for those selfish people that are upset by the fact so many people want to end their life. There is a reason it is called ‚Äûmentalhealth‚Äú. Instead of hiding ugly truths with pretty lies, why not work toward improving it? So you see a drastic increase in suicide. That should tell you something or trigger initiative, it you‚Äòre that concerned about it. Lastly, I really don‚Äòt want to be that guy but when you‚Äòre browsing through a behavioural health sub of any kind, you need to have some thick skin because you will read A LOT of fucked up things and censoring everything you don‚Äòt like does not make it an inclusive environment for those people that need it - which is what the sub is designed for in the first place.

I can‚Äòt count how many times I‚Äòve wanted to or came close to committing suicide and had no where to go and no one to talk to because I don‚Äòt have friends and every sub would say ‚Äûdont talk about suicide!‚Äú. I also hate the crises line and have known several people that agree with me on it‚Äòs matters. How many people did they find hanging from the ceiling because there was no available support? That is a serious problem, coming from someone who has been on suicide watch 4-5 times now.",2023-01-30 21:56:40,10126hf

there have been three people in my family line with this condition and the hardest part is you feel like you are just another one waiting to be doomed. I lost a cousin to suicide. we weren't that close but the thought that he had the same condition I did and the possibilities of me doing that to myself and my family were and still are scary realities for me.

I'm not trying to make it about me. forgiving yourself and the other party is the hardest thing with suicide but it's possible and I think it's awesome that you are able to come on here and encourage others while you yourself are in such a tough place.",2023-04-14 11:26:25,12lz7fz

My mom didn‚Äôt commit suicide so to say - but she was a severe alcoholic and drank herself to death when I was 19. I too had not seen or talked to her in a while. The last conversation I had with her, I told her if she was going to mess with my life then she could stay out of it (she got mad at my grandmother for helping me buy food cause I had a 3 year old.) she was dead about 3 weeks later.

I don‚Äôt know the circumstances but assuming you distanced yourself bc of her symptoms of bi-polar, please try not to beat yourself up over it. My mom was on a drunkin rampage when she flipped out on my grandma. 

I beat myself up about it for a long time, but she really gave me no choice.

I read a thing that Mr Rodgers said:

&#x200B;

‚ÄúWhen I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news,‚Äù Rogers said to his television neighbors, ‚Äúmy mother would say to me, ‚ÄòLook for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.‚Äô‚Äù

&#x200B;

Thats what I started doing. Look at the people running to help. This helps me balance things a bit. Yeah there are bad people but overwhelmingly there are good people too. Bad people get headlines, good don't.

It sucks. 

I marched in a political rally in 2022 and was terrified the whole time that we‚Äôd be shot at or run over.

From my perspective, in the USA, one political party is active in keeping guns widely available and one is not.

So now I‚Äôm a precinct chair in the pro-control side. 

I can either live in fear, or I can harness my moral outrage while I manage my fear.

I was fortunate to know there was a school shooter on campus before getting on the bus to head onto UT Campus.

I was fortunate to know my uncle left the wal mart early when the El Paso shooter from Plano hit up that same wal mart. A high school friend was impacted. It hurt to hear that.

I was literally down the street from Curtis Cutwell when the shooter ‚Äúattempted‚Äù to shoot up a convention in Garland. Literally less half a mile from where i was, same street. FBI prevented that one. But still, it sucked to know.

At this point, i am numb, i am suppressing the need to give this any of my attention, because i know it deserves none if legislation doesnt seem to think it does. I hate this state, Texas, but i was born and raised here, home is a love-hate because of how people fail to see how this is all hypocritical with being anti abortion. I am angry with you too, but you wont see this from me if you met me. Because this is straight B.S., but i am tired of preaching. 

It‚Äôs probably one of the many reasons i dont have kids, its def one of the reason. I wouldn‚Äôt have the words to explain to them why i brought them into this world. (If they feared going to school) A world where having trauma might as well be a norm. (If they ever ran out school, saw friends die, or witnessed something they shouldnt have because of gun violence)

(I guess im venting too, I know there was another shooting, but i still refuse to know the details. )

We have politicians who produce soundbites for their political gain on both sides, and it's really not helping. We need action. If politicians in government really wanted to prioritize mental health or go as far to ban guns or arm every citizen (whatever anyone's version of the solution is), they could get that done within, at most, maybe a year. But politicians are doing nothing and letting all of this happen as it has for many upon many years.

Now, as regular people and citizens, I suppose what we all really need to do is be there for each other and care for each other in every way we can, and spread love to everyone around us. We should do that by having meaningful conversations with each other, and by caring for each other mentally (by asking how others are doing in terms of mental health). That would solve a lot of the problems that we have.

As for now, we all need to be activists in our own way and give voice to expanding mental health resources for those who need it and prioritize cheaper therapy and whatnot for those who can't afford it.

GWhiz4u,"Agree, it's everywhere and I think it's intentional than necessary. Not to dive into any thing political, but sadly humans will always try to kill humans. If you ban, a certain item or tool, humans will try to find another method or tool to do so, or create an item to do so. It's the knowledge and intent behind the device/tool/item being used. 
Our society needs to be fixed no doubt about it.
Yet, we cannot punish/imprison/shame someone for having an item in this case a weapon. 
To do so harms innocent lives and can create a nightmare for those who may need that item/tool in their lives.
Culture shapes policy and the system that governs. If we have a culture based on responsibility and positive morals, and a healthy society then we will lessen the frequency and possible severity of such terrible incidents.

jmnugent,"The USA has had something like 12 or 13 different Federal firearms laws since the original NFA in 1934. That's an average of 1 new Federal Law every 8 to 9 years .. for the past 100 years running. 

Mass shootings didn't really start becoming a thing till the late 70's or early 80's. Even the oft-maligned AR-15 came out in the late 1950's - early 1960's. Why didn't we start having mass shooting immediately upon it's release ?

Per my previous comment (higher up)... the percentage of guns in the USA that's ""the problem"".. is something like 0.001% ... we could make 1000 new laws tomorrow and it likely wouldn't solve a percentage that small. 

For comparison,. we have plenty of tools (Registration, training, insurance, etc) for getting your Drivers License and driving.. but we still have a rough average of 40,000 vehicular deaths per year. (roughly the same as the number of firearms deaths we have). 

If our goal is to ""save the most lives"".. and we were going to make a priority-list of the things we should focus on most,.. we should focus on mental health and suicide-prevention. Roughly 50% (26,000 out of yearly 40,000 firearms-deaths) are suicides. We could cut the yearly firearms deaths down by half if we focus resources on nationwide improvements to mental health support (and doing so would have positive ripple effects across other areas of society as well). 

In my view,. that's probably the single most effective thing we could so. Improve mental health support for the 2 most prominent ""at risk groups"" (teens and middle age white men.. the 2 groups most prone to suicide attempts).",2023-05-08 05:15:01,13a91l3

No one buys a gun thinking they might use it for self defense. (You can‚Äôt carry it around with you in most countries anyways.) But to hunt animals.

But I have built systems in place and have started the conversations with students in assemblies to get rid of any possible stigma and to foster dialogue and understanding that mental health is health! 

It has been a challenge trying to get a whole school to change their focus and mindset about how they view their mindset, but definitely working towards a more aware and equipped community. We continue the work at our level and I‚Äôm sure other schools are doing similar things",2023-03-16 16:47:49,11sry7b
BrightAshes,"I KNOW that if I and my family had been educated on mental health my life would've been much better.  What I have is treatable and I could've lived a relatively normal life if I had just received support.  Instead, I've lost years of my life and have developed additional complications due to the stress and trauma of struggling for decades on my own.  

I agree with you.  It would be wonderful if part of our standard education would include teaching people about how to keep our minds healthy and what one can do if they ever need help.",2023-03-16 19:36:02,11sry7b

tootiredforthis16,"The problem is that many teachers won‚Äôt make time for these types of lessons or don‚Äôt feel comfortable teaching these topics. Additionally, these topics can be difficult for younger students to understand and older students to take seriously.

My district tried to implement a wellness week and it didn‚Äôt really go as planned. The elementary school kids (k-5) were confused by the topics of mental health and wellness, and didn‚Äôt really grasp the significance of it. Meanwhile the older kids from middle school and up seemed to get it, but some of these students would blow it off or just flat out not take the material seriously.

Additionally, we had a lot of teachers and classroom aids upset because we had to implement lots of schedule changes to accommodate for the new material. Many teachers felt they were cramped for time and some felt they were under qualified to teach on mental health.

It is a good idea in theory, but can be very difficult to implement.",2023-03-16 23:09:27,11sry7b

Affectionate_Oil_284,"I dont know kids are weird, they may trie and emulate this behaviour for attention or something making real genuine diagnoses harder.

If any i believe  that counsilors, teachers or other educational personel should be made more aware that this exists and be able to communicate this to parents/school counsilor. Now teachers are already about as overworked and underpayed as you can get. so adding more workload to them is probably unfair.  
But still psychological issues will only continue to become a bigger issue in society at large. If we dont invest in some kind of adequate measures to recognise these issues early and combat this we risk marginalising groups of people that with some help could have good lives and contribute to society, instead we largely leave them out in the cold to figure out confusing and daunting healtcare systems and insurance to maybe help their issues.

Redgrievedemonboy,"One thing my psychiatrist told me recently is dealing with invisible mental disorders like mine is kind of like isometric weight lifting as opposed to people without these disorders doing normal lifting. I feel like I'm lifting a lot of weight and I'm busy but it's my mind, its not visible from the outside. whereas normal weight lifting and appearingly busy people are the same. I like this comparison as it reminds me that I'm not always just doing ""nothing"", my struggles are just different.

On a side note, I recently moved out on my own in a studio apartment. I've been struggling with severe OCD, chronic anxiety and depression majorly for 10 years now and am 29. I have learned it's important since living here alone that it's significant to sustaining my mental health if I just do one thing that instills me with confidence or feeling good about myself like taking care of a responsibility a day no matter how small, even if it's washing just a few dishes, you're progressing and doing something as opposed to nothing at all.",2023-04-13 04:44:15,12k1zw4

Even at home, i really wonder how many people do a workout with intense exercise when they get bad news, like that someone passed away.

I resort to things like stoicism, because you can use these mental strategies without being in a certain place or have some things around you.

These advices are more like when you have time to do something, but not in the moment, when something very bad happens.",2023-03-25 02:27:28,12113am

swild89,"So this TIPP skill was developed specifically for what you says it is not, as part of DBT (dialectical behavioural therapy) so no worries, you not connecting doesn‚Äôt give me any personal offense :) 

the skill is to find something in the moment that can get you through the intense emotions. We can‚Äôt all intensely exercise in every moment, but we can access an ice cube or a sink with cold water, a moment to practice breathing technique, or do some jumping jacks.

Zealousideal-Pair-82,"I read all of that and I am so sorry for what you‚Äôre going through. My mother was also bat shit crazy and would attack me.

If you are having struggles financially and focusing on your studies because of domestic violence, I‚Äôve been there too and that‚Äôs why I ran away from home. 

I can‚Äôt say what‚Äôs right for you. You already did the right thing and gif her detained. 

But you could go on an adventure and step out in faith and with a spirit of wonder learn new things and make new connections that will turn into lifelong friends. 

When I ran away from home, I wasn‚Äôt able to get anyone in trouble for abusing me. So maybe what I did won‚Äôt work for you. 

But I encourage you to explore, even if it‚Äôs just to explore your options. Ask yourself what your dreams have always been, and in small steps see how you can realize them. 

You could look up your nearest Rainbow Gathering. Or a book club, those are free. Or a meditation club that‚Äôs free. Or pursue any hobby that is free, like chess club increases your logic. And just to meet new people. And always practice gratitude. When you are grateful for what you do have, you will be in alignment to manifest more. 

And also, people love helping those who have a grateful heart. 

If you feel comfortable dm ‚Äòng me your birthdate, I can do an astrology reading for you. I really want to help you. I am also going to pray for you to Cosmic Consciousness. 

Meditate. Be grateful. Have faith. Do what feels right, always. Trust your gut. You‚Äôve done so well already. I‚Äôm so proud of you.",2023-03-17 12:09:22,11tyk7d

Diacetyl-Morphin,"I'm sorry for you, i can't really tell you much but i've got bipolar disorder myself. Your mom needs serious treatment, even when it is against her will and she's involuntary committed to a mental health clinic. There is no other way. Without treatment, your mom will always be in mood swings between depression and mania. She needs therapy and meds.

Before this is done, it is better to be separated from your mother. Don't trust people as long as they are not in treatment, because they will always fall back in the same behavior.

Maybe you will understand me as a man with bipolar disorder, when i say, i don't want kids. You see it with your mother, the episodes of mania and depression, the risk she puts you in, the things she is capable of like setting everything on fire. This can be dangerous for life, it's a serious thing. 

The doctors will administer the meds, they'll probably use an antipsychotic like haldolperidol first to bring her down. Then she'll need Lithium as a mood stabilizer, maybe an antidepressiva for depression and a downer for mania. Problem is, even when she gets the right meds from the start now, it will take weeks to months for the effects.

The problem is her behavior, if she doesn't participate in therapy and doesn't take the meds, there's no hope for a change. Someone has to reach her, to tell her that she needs this. Unfortunately, this is very difficult, people like her will say ""I don't want this, i don't need this, let me go from the clinic! I'm fine!"". 

Sometimes, the state has to use force to get these people into therapy against their will. That's hard, but there's no other choice.

I hope you can go somewhere now, i don't know about the UK, but we have homes for people like you in Switzerland. These are most often for women, which are treated and in danger because of their ex-husbands. A friend did go there, it was a safe place that was hidden and under surveillance by the state. You need to find such a place in UK.

I hope you can go there and i wish you the best for your future. If you have any questions about bipolar disorder, which i maybe can answer, feel free to ask, what can be done to help your mom.",2023-03-18 13:47:05,11tyk7d

Self-reflection can be a helpful tool in gaining clarity of thought and understanding of your situation. One technique that can be used is journaling. Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you identify patterns, triggers, and areas of concern. It can also help you articulate your situation to others.

Another technique is mindfulness. This involves focusing on the present moment and accepting your thoughts and feelings without judgment. Mindfulness can help you gain clarity of thought and reduce stress and anxiety.

It's important to seek professional help if you are struggling with mental health concerns. A mental health coach or therapist can provide guidance and support in developing coping strategies and improving your overall well-being.

New_Beautiful3632,">Yes, being healthy is a choice however its a lot easier to eat takeout and not workout than it is to eat healthy and be active. 

That just circular. People 'choose' to be sedentary or eat takeout because it's more pleasant than the alternative. Gaming, Netflix, socializing etc. is more rewarding than the gym. Eating take out is more rewarding than making yourself a healthy meal. That behavior itself is an example of how compulsive our decisions are. We know what's best for us but don't do it anyway because we're always chasing what gives us the most pleasure at this very moment.  

The thing is, healthy people will stop doing it if it's destroying their lives because they also get pleasure from pursuing long term goals and at some point the *transient* pleasure they get from pursuing that goal outweighs the easy fix. 

When someone takes it to an extreme to the point where they become miserable from eating junk food or sitting on the couch all day, you're back at mental illness. Clearly the problem there still isn't that people 'choose' to be miserable but that they just don't get the same satisfaction from pursuing long term goals like a normal person does.",2023-04-23 02:07:19,12vf38p

There are people who are depressed mostly because of an old trauma they haven't processed well and a reliance on unhealthy coping skills.

I think the big problem with therapy for the second group is that the therapist can't get the person out of their bad situation. All they can really do is give the person short term fixes so maybe they have the energy to change the parts of their life that they need to.

If you choose to eat a salad it's not because you're influencing your brain. You *are* your brain. At that exact moment the thought of eating healthy just causes a bigger influx of hormones than unhealthy food.

And if those hormones aren't there you won't do it, end of story. Healthy people don't have more free will, they're just... healthy. Hence circular logic, you're saying healthy people *can* make the right choice because they *do* make the right choice because they *can* make the right choice. After all if someone doesn't they're mentally ill by definition.

Not to say healthy people *never* make a bad choice because everyone gives in from time to time and that's the point. If it were a choice we would always pick what benefits us most long term. Instead we might not go to the gym because we had a bad day and the weather is shit. The rational conclusion is the same, exercising will make us happier, but the chemical response *just isn't there* to make us go.

Another case in point is heroin addiction. It doesn't matter what kind of person you were before, the moment ""I should do heroin"" is the largest trigger for hormone activity, there's no amount of 'willpower' or insight in the world that's going to stop you from devolving into a shell of a person doing nothing but scrambling to get your next hit.

Even if researchers and experts don't know the reason there certainly is. 

My empathy goes more to those with situational depression than the ones with clinical. Why.?: because as long as they have the problems that they have the depression is not going to leave no matter the therapy or the drugs. The latter help one to deal with the problems. So if one has unrepairable problems like chronic pain issues and he can't accept that then nothing will get rid of their depression. On the other hand clinical depression can be treated more easily with drugs and there aren't (possibly) any external problems. It has more to do with you and your biological make-up.

The salad one shows how your analogy fits without needing choice and the latter shows we maximize pleasure now no matter what.

>Again, I dont think you understand what circular logic means.

Maybe I misread? You said people can choose to be happy unless they're mentally ill. That means people can choose to be happy because they choose to be happy. 

 
>we dont actually have any free will or control over our lives since all our ‚Äúdecisions‚Äù are just hormones and chemicals. 

Free will and choice are just labels for what we experience, the issue is explaining their mechanisms. If you treat yourself as something living in your brain, free will doesn't exist. If you treat yourself as your brain, what you just described *is* free will. 

So it is real but material, not spiritual. It's chemicals and brain structure which like everything needs external influence to change. We have freedom to choose *because* we have a pre-existing identity making us want and able to choose in the first place.

If you disagree or can mesh that with the idea of 'self intervention' I'd love to find out about your views.

You said I believe my thing and you believe your thing like it's religion or something. What am I supposed to say to that?

I already explained my position on free will and asked you how 'self intervention' is supposed to work on a mechanical level because I'm genuinely curious, but you didn't answer.

If I had responded I would've just said your premise is wrong because your idea of free will is an outdated religious concept that isn't very compatible with science and only moves the problem to whatever realm you think free will comes from anyway, then say something about how you shouldn't be telling people how things are when you think it's unknown and you'd probably just say something about me being nihilistic or something and we'd end up nowhere.",2023-04-23 18:09:49,12vf38p

From NIH: There is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis.

With treatment, most people with ankylosing spondylitis can have productive lives.

The thing is that these things it suggests are hard to do because they should be done often if one with this condition wants to have a productive (enough) life.

Working_Razzmatazz63,"Your frustrations with the cost of therapy are entirely understandable. It can indeed be a significant financial burden for many people. However, it's important to remember that therapy is a professional service provided by trained individuals who have invested much time and money into their education. Despite the costs, many people find therapy incredibly helpful for managing and improving their mental health.  
  
That being said, there are several alternatives or supplements to traditional therapy that can be considered:  
  
Online Therapy Platforms: Websites and apps like Aidacura, Talkspace, and others offer therapy services at a fraction of the cost of traditional in-person therapy. Aidacura is free and utilizes AI and other tools.  
  
Self-Help Books and Resources: Many great self-help books and online resources can help you gain insight into your thoughts and behaviours. Some popular ones include ""Feeling Good"" by David Burns and ""The Happiness Trap"" by Russ Harris.  
  
Support Groups: Support groups (both in-person and online) can be a great resource. They offer a space where you can share your experiences and hear from others who are going through similar situations. Sites like Meetup and online forums may have groups related to what you're experiencing.  
  
Hotlines and Text Lines: These are free services where you can talk to someone immediately. They're not a substitute for ongoing therapy, but they can be very helpful in a crisis.  
  
Sliding Scale Therapists: Some therapists offer sliding scale fees, meaning they adjust the cost based on your income.  
  
Community Health Centers: These centres often provide mental health services on a sliding scale.  
  
University Training Clinics: If you live near a university, they may have a training clinic where graduate students provide therapy under the supervision of licensed therapists, often at a reduced cost.  
  
Mindfulness and Meditation: Practices like mindfulness and meditation can help manage stress, anxiety, and depression. There are many free resources and apps available to guide you.  
  
Remember, while these resources can be helpful, they may not entirely replace the benefits of one-on-one therapy with a trained professional, especially for more severe mental health concerns.  
  
As for medication, it's important to note that not all therapists can or will prescribe medication. Only psychiatrists and some other medical doctors can prescribe. While medication isn't always necessary, it can be a vital part of treatment for some people. If cost is a concern, there are often generic versions of medications that are significantly cheaper, and assistance programs are available for some medications as well.  
  
Finally, talking about previous conversations in therapy isn't necessarily ""filler"" - it's a way to reflect on progress, deepen understanding, and connect past insights to the present moment. Therapy is often a process of building on each session, rather than starting from scratch every time. But if you feel your time isn't being used effectively, it's important to communicate that to your therapist.

I agree also about everyone constantly pushing meds. My (brand new, as in seen her twice) GP is currently trying to push me to start new antidepressants.

Mental health care is pretty atrocious tbh. Even with it covered, I tried psychiatry because I wanted an official diagnosis. I KNOW there's something up with me that's a bit... beyond anxiety and depression, like I'm DEFINITELY not normal. But they just threw medication at me that made me feel worse.

golitsyn_nosenko,"Some quick questions:

If your knee was injured and it impaired your every day activities, how much money might you spend on surgery and rehab to get it right? 

Truth is you‚Äôll probably depend on your mind far more than almost any part of your body across virtually every activity you do throughout the entirety of your life. It‚Äôs worth getting it sorted out early rather than not doing so, labouring on, and it impacting your choices for weeks, months, years or decades before you finally decide to do something about it.

Another way of looking at it might be how much money would you spend if untreated on dysfunctional behaviour, choices, or compensating for emotional pain? (e.g. drinking, smoking, gambling, divorces, legal fees, impulsive decisions, etc)

Ultimately it‚Äôs your choice, but if you want someone who is appropriately trained with 6+ years of tertiary study, who take on considerable risk, are obligated to complete costly supervision and continuous professional development, they need to be fairly compensated for their dedication and professionalism.

That said, there are often low cost options for therapists if you‚Äôre willing to do some searching (state-sponsored or even employer-sponsored programs) or you could try other interventions for mental health (e.g. exercise) which show significant efficacy in improving mental health.

It can be really tough, particularly if you have mental health issues that require long term management, but if you think from the perspective of comparing to a physical health complaint as opposed to comparing to a general conversation with a random person, it might give you incentive to address it like the health issue it really is.

Wishing you well, hope you find a way through the challenges.",2023-05-20 19:39:13,13mo21z

Constant-Fondant5454,"I understand your frustration and thought I could offer another perspective. I am a Holistic Counsellor but obviously I am just a human being myself so I dedicate a lot of my time to self-healing and personal growth which means I am constantly working with therapists and counsellors.

Personally, I think it comes down to the VALUE of what you are getting out of something. Most people would spend that kind of money to get their car serviced without batting an eyelid, but when it comes to working on ourselves we don‚Äôt see it as a valuable thing to invest in ourselves. When you find the right person to work with, the money is always worth it in my opinion but sometimes the key thing is finding the right therapist/counsellor in the first place. There are a lot of qualified people in the world but it doesn‚Äôt mean they are competent or good at what they do. Someone who is good at what they do is hard to find and if you find one, they will properly support you to achieve what you are wanting which is a blessing and invaluable. It is unlikely you will just find this person at the first place you go and may take some time. The issue could be that you haven‚Äôt found the right person that makes it feel valuable to you. I always find it helpful to be super clear on what I want/need from a Counsellor/Therapist and be as SPECIFIC as possible in your mind around what type of person they would be and how they would treat you. If you talk with anyone who doesn't feel aligned, trust your instincts and move on.",2023-05-21 19:43:57,13mo21z
maricantera,"I'm very disillusioned by the medical system all in all. From my own experience. If you have this kind of budget, make sure to be THRILLED with the help you're getting. 

I am all for getting help, doing it all alone is I think probably possible, but exhausting and much like with self home repair, sometimes it gets messy 

I personally had the worst experience with a psychiatrist trying to push meds on me without even really talking to me properly, so I went the alternative way - psychedelics, coaching, traveling, and lots and lots of deep self healing. And I am now grateful that the psychiatrist was as awful as she was, because I love where I am. 

I fully acknowledge this is my experience only, I am sure there are great therapists. 

But you should really be happy with the therapist you're seeing. Especially these days when there is a literal abundance of specialized help. 

And don't be afraid to try a coach, you will find one that specializes in your exact issue and the 1st session is usually for free, which I don't know if therapists do this.

I say this because calling around once they find out you don't have private insurance they say they aren't taking it or the dr only takes medicaid at the emergency rooms .

DullIntroduction7621,"Hi there! I think hearing my story might help you understand your situation better (i know it helps me a lot when someone does it for me.)

 I'm a first year Bachelor student of a very strict program. We have mandatory attendance, have few retake opportunities for exams, very strict grade boundaries, lots of exams, and a very strict head of the program.

Yet, I've recently had a depressive/suicidal episode coupled with physical illness. I decided to write to the head of the program, and the professor replied to me quickly and much more eloquently than usual and said I should take time to rest, that exams and classes could wait and that all that was important was my well-being. Most important of all, he reassured me that he'd be there for me and understood the situation.

This is all to say: it doesn't matter how strict the course, or how important the exam is, your HEALTH, whether mental or physical, comes first!! Your teacher either lacks empathy, or, for whatever reason, is stuck into believing that his exam is far more important than anything else.

Don't listen to him, speak to any higher ups and report the incident. This is not ok, and could easily out someone over the edge, he should be held accountable for his lack of empathy and should receive training on that 

I wish you the best, and, if you need someone to talk to, please do pm me! I'll be there for you",2023-04-19 13:32:54,12rm4tl

Lengthofawhile,"That's not really an acceptable thing for your chemistry prof to say. A lot of things are ""part of a job"" but that in no way means that people can't or shouldn't have strong emotions about them. If you feel up to making a complaint sometime, he definitely deserves one. I'm really sorry you're going through this. 

I know this might sound silly. But there was a study a while back that looked at playing logic/geometric games (specifically Tetris in the study) as relief after traumatic experiences. It did show some success. The idea was that playing the game took computing power away from the emotional part of the brain. It's a strategy that's pretty much risk free to try since it can't really do any harm and there are a lot of free games online.

I unfortunately witnessed things that nobody should, actually seen the worst the world has to offer because of being in a rough crowd. A crowd that essentially laughs at child deaths, and I didn't realize it for so long. I have been traumatized by it too. Unfortunately I didn't realize I was, but when I did, I had to do something about it, so I started watching more of the content they watch, until I reached a climax that change my life for the better. I saw it as respecting and mourning the passing of those people, and learning from it. We're in different situations, but the one thing I can suggest is to actually get desensitized to it. I'm not so desensitized that I don't recognize death and violence for that matter as bad. I can now somewhat tolerate blood and death. 

As much as I hate the advice ""Man up."", it is the only way to overcome those experiences. I watched a baby starve to death, again because of the fucked up crowd. The way I view things, you have to treat these aspects of life as the enemy. This video was online by the way, as was everything else.

It's normal for you to undergo a psychological shock. You'll need time to recover from that. But I'd advise that you don't forgetyour Chem professor's advice. As rude as he was, even you know this is the truth. 

What you have to register is that this shock is due to your feeling guilty about your inability to save the kid. Please don't take it personally that way. Otherwise you'll suffer a burnout very quickly, given the career you're in. You are only there to provide as much help as you can render to humanity.

And this is the reality of all. Every victim who will suffer a horrible accident or violence, will only suffer until there's life in their bodies. So in that regard, consider the passing away of the kid in your embrace the last act of mercy to the kid by the universe.

ychris3737,"I hear you bud. The professor should be the least of your worries, missing an exam, or even failing a class or having to take an extra semester or retake the class in the summer is so insignificant you‚Äôll likely forget about it or laugh at the fact that you even worried in just a few years.

As in for your job, it is true that it is your line of work to expect those things but it doesn‚Äôt mean that it shouldn‚Äôt affect you when it happens. If you felt nothing and just got right back to living your life normally, id be more worried. So be kind to yourself.

With that said, also be objective enough to see that not only is it not your fault or your responsibility, but that things like this happen every second. Life sucks, people suck, and good innocent people die. 

Everyday babies are thrown in the trash, family members and friends murder each other for money, lovers betray each other, innocent people get killed, people are raped, and children are abused. These things are happening every second as you read this. Existence is pain, humanity is doomed, and there is no inherent meaning to life whatsoever. So find comfort in knowing that even tho it sucks, it sucks for everyone, all the time, and that is the only constant in our existence. 

Best part of all, you get to choose how you react to the pain and dread of existence and everyday life, you get to create meaning out of nothing, and like everything and everybody else, there is no winning or losing in life, we‚Äôre all headed to the same destination.

pnwerewolf,"A few things. 

1) I'm so sorry you had to go through this. At the very least, you all gave that child comfort in its last moments. In time you will appreciate just how important that is. 

2) If you are in the US and you are studying at any higher educational institution, like a college (fully accredited 4 year or community college) or a university, I would first reach out to your professor one more time and just explain that you are having substantial physical and mental effects from this event and insist on your need for an accommodation. You've experienced a major trauma - yes, you'll adjust in time given the field you're in, but I'm gathering you're still new-ish, if it's having this effect on you still and you haven't yet found a process to navigate situations like this, and you don't have good coping skills yet. Major traumas like this can and do cause PTSD, and while obviously you wouldn't have it yet and may not get it at all - statistics say you likely won't, at the very least - it's better to take the time you need to process this and stay well than it is to just muscle through it. If you phrase it this way, he may be more likely to help. And don't underplay your hand or minimize what you've been through. Seriously.

3) If your professor still gives you grief, go to his superior/the department head and explain the situation, too. I would also convey to the department head that your other professors have been accommodating, and let him know you're not expecting to get out of the test, you just need to have some time to try to process this and learn the skills to be able to do that healthily for your own well being because *you will have to do this again and again in your line of work.* Muscling through it now will only hinder you in the long run, right?

4) At the same time, reach out to your student health center or whoever it is that helps students to deal with student life and mental health stuff to at the very least see if there are supportive resources you could use to help you deal with this. At the very least, doing this while also approaching your professor/his department head conveys to them that you are actually being proactive about this part of your education - which is exactly what this is, as learning coping skills to deal with the traumas inherent in your line of work is part and parcel of your education (you won't be an effective EMT if you don't learn how to actually cope with and process the traumas you'll see) - and not just trying to squeeze out some extra time to study or whatever. Again, you've been through a traumatic experience and just because you're a student doesn't (and presumably ""young and resilient"") doesn't at all mean you should minimize what you've been through. 

5) Just as an aside, your professors mentality is literally what is driving nurses to quit in droves and is what drives doctors to kill themselves. Without our minds, we are literally nothing and managing our mental health is literally managing the health of our existence. If you haven't already responded, I would respond to his comment of it being ""part of the job"" by saying literally ""yes, trauma is part of my job. I will encounter it every single day I am at work. Trauma directly and immediately effects our mental health and in order to do my best work in my job, I need to learn how to positively and proactively manage that. That's what I'm doing right now, learning to maintain my mental health, because managing my mental health is part of my job.""

I know this is a lot to jump through, but honestly, I have had a few close folks in the armed forces who became EMTs after discharge and the ones that hadn't learned how to cope with being in the service and the traumas they encountered there, and/or the ones who weren't able to or chose not to learn how to process trauma generally were absolutely unable to cope with the traumas of being an EMT. They quickly left that line of work. The sooner you learn how to process and cope, the better off you'll be - not just in this line of work, but in your whole life - and sadly, culture just hasn't caught up with understanding how important learning to deal with trauma is, and so there's the added burden on those of us who do have to deal with mental health issues that we also have to learn how to be our own best advocate. We're conditioned to think that advocating for our health is being a squeaky wheel - and squeaky wheels get greased - but the fact of the matter is that the only other choice is to just collapse into total disfunction once we run out of the sheer adrenaline that comes with white-knuckling it through each day.",2023-04-19 16:07:51,12rm4tl

It‚Äôs okay to feel what you need to feel. I can not imagine the scene of what you experienced. And maybe look for a blessing in this as you do what you do is for a reason and the reasons are of what you experienced and will experience.

RWPossum,"I really think you need professional help, but I know that it's hard for people to get therapy these days. People your age in particular often find it hard.  
  
I hope you'll talk with your parents about this. They can help you with the things I'm talking about here.  
  
If you can't see a therapist, self-help is better than nothing. A lot of people benefit from it. Self-help is a way to show you're serious that doesn't create friction in the family. In fact, it wouldn't be surprising if your parents liked some healthy changes in your behavior.  
  
Self-help can be educational for parents as well as kids. A good self-help book explains what therapy for depression is like.  
  
With depression, there's what seems like a Catch 22. People say, ""I know there are things that will make me feel better - getting exercise, taking care of myself, straightening up the house and cleaning, but I'm depressed and I don't have the energy.‚Äù  
  
Here's the thing - very important. People do have energy when they're depressed - as much energy as they always do, but for some reason, the system is reluctant to let you use your energy.  
  
We have to use psychology to coax energy out of our systems. Psychology has some nifty tricks.  
  
A famous psychiatrist, Abraham Low, said that when we can't control our feelings we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you our of bed or to the bathroom for a shower, they will obey.  
  
Try this when it seems that you're too tired to work. Lie on the couch, close your eyes, and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for 5 minutes.  
  
This is a motivation trick that's been used in behavior modification programs since the 1930s. If a task seems like it's too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time, and start with something really, really easy. Cleaning - start by cleaning for 3 or 4 min and take a 5 min break. Homework - start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you're going to read by looking at headings, sub-headings, etc.  
  
You don't have to be an athlete to benefit from exercise. As little as 20 min brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you don't make yourself sick of exercise with too much and quit. Steve Ilardi, the therapist/researcher who headed the lifestyle-depression project at the Univ of Kansas, talks about enjoyable ways to get exercise.  
  
If you go to Metapsychology, you can read a psychologist's review of Dr Ilardi's book (""splendid"").  
  
Of all the traditional mind-body practices (meditation, etc.), the one with the best evidence for affecting mood disorders is slow breathing. It‚Äôs used for treating anxiety, depression, panic disorder, and PTSD. It's safe and it doesn't take any training.  
  
Video, below - details about self-help based on cognitive-behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression - nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise, and social support, also traditional Asian methods.  
  
It has advice specifically for depressed students, such as StudentsAgainstDepression.org.  
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqEM\_jlDRZI  
  
Always remember that there are people you can talk to, like a school counselor.

Losing a dearly loved one to suicide is from my experience the single worst pain. It's devastating. There's just so many questions and no answers. To this day it still hurts. 
I lost my best friend in 2014. He was 20. Barely started his life proper. He struggled with depression for years but no one knew just how bad. He noted he didn't think anyone would care in his note. *Over 350 people turned up to his funeral.*  I was speechless. - the point is you've touched more people's lives than you know, and you will continue to do so. 

Everything may seem shit and you may not see how youre going to make it day by day. But you will have good days. In those good times you will see the true beauty of the world.

If you feel like shit don‚Äôt dwell in it, try your best to take action and push forward. I know those negative emotions and thought loop might render for quite some time but only you can make it better. We love you as human beings and it would hurt us all if you left.

I saw a post once that was saying that the urge to want to die is often a substitute for wanting something else. If you don't like your life as it currently is, it can be hard to picture wanting a life at all. But you'll find that life one day. You'll figure it out.",2023-04-01 01:28:04,127jf0t

due to a bunch of mental health factors and environmental factors in my life I was becoming overrun with resentment and hate and overall hopelessness (and a soul crushing opiate addiction). 

Psychedelics radically helped me flip the script on a life that was headed no where. I understand that‚Äôs a debatable subject in a mental health group; but I‚Äôm bipolar and psychedelics have helped me long term become a person I can love and accept, and that love has radiated throughout all avenues of my life tenfold since that. I was on lithium for years and that was a band aid. These experiences with psychedelics have rewired my brain and the way I think and function. Im still the same person, but now far better equipped to deal with my issues.

AChaoticStorm,"Do you know when all hope is gone?

It‚Äôs when there is no chance to change. It‚Äôs when you no longer notice, you no longer care, and you no longer call out. 

That‚Äôs not this time, this post wouldn‚Äôt be made if it was.

Hate is an intoxicant for some. It has its own numbing agent. 

More good news. You are not denying it, your accepting it. So now it‚Äôs time to let it go and let light in. The way I do this is portraying that hate and anger. I do this with digital art. Carl Jung goes over the ideology of the shadow that we all have. 

My guess is you do have this hate, but when faced with the choice of helping someone you see in pain, you help. This is because your not denying the dark feelings you have. There are people out there who show toxic positivity and I don‚Äôt trust them. Socially and even to themselves they come off as light and positive but deep down they don‚Äôt give a fuck about anyone else and would push down an old lady to get what they want. 

Even if you don‚Äôt like the music, check out this song if you want  https://youtu.be/3RUSpSMmqag . 

Life is a duality of light and dark. Try to portray the dark you are noticing through art of some kind. It‚Äôs not about making an art that others understand or even appreciate, it‚Äôs about making an art piece or pieces that shows that darkness in you. 

I try to portray that darkness while accepting light in and embracing it as I‚Äôm releasing the hateful and angry side of myself.

If your curious about this post bc of the bipolar / mental health aspect in general I‚Äôd recommend trying low doses of mushrooms and working your way up.

I'm just saying the rest because it sound like you would like to actually lose weight.

However, the saying goes ""you can't out run a bad diet""- no amount of exercise will help to lose (or sometimes even to stop gaining) if you are eating too many calories.

Especially because of your age, I would ask a doctor or nutritionist the recommended calorie goal per day to lose, and also dietary requirements (how much protein, how many servings of fruits, veg etc)

It is possible to have a healthy (all be it restrictive) diet, and still be healthy and not go into eating disorder territory, but especially since you are still a teen, be careful.

strouhymore,"A bit of advice from personal experience:

Do not beat yourself too hard if you stop for a bit. A lot of people seem to think that starting is the hardest but not stopping is in my opinion way harder. 

Do NOT compare yourself/your progress to others. I know this might sound a bit cringe but you should deffinetly take progress pics (i personally take one every +-2 weeks, you don't wanna do it too often cause it would be harder to see any progress tho ), if you feel bad about yourself, you can look at them to see the progress you've made a lot clearer, and trust me, seeing even the smallest change on your body is an awesome feeling.

Anyways, you got it, don't give up. Excersising is the way i managed to somewhat get rid of my depression, if i can do it you can for sure do it too.",2023-04-07 01:44:38,12dc7tt

KingHuge19,"Listen I‚Äôm 23 and am at 230.  9 months ago I was at 280.  I only went to the gym for about 4-5 months before losing motivation.  I‚Äôm starting again now.  Anyway that 50lb lost was not hard.  You just have to do it.  I hated cardio.  But it‚Äôs how I shedded tons of weight even though I ate like shit and still do.   As a bigger guy it didn‚Äôt take much to get my heart rate up and sweating.  Yoga and stretching is good.  But I can‚Äôt it enough recommend just fast walking and getting on a treadmill. I started by making a commitment to doing a 5k (3.14miles) a day.  Then adding elevation as it got easier.  

Everyone is different but weight loss isn‚Äôt impossible.  Another thing I‚Äôve done is realize my weaknesses.  I suck at planning and cooking healthy meals.  So I have to burn at least 2000 calories.  I portion control very hard but I eat garbage food.  But even then the calorie deficit works.  But keep going it sucks at first but quickly will become easier.",2023-04-23 23:42:57,12dc7tt

1. You can't afford luxury. Okay, do things for fun that are free. Take a walk. Maybe your local animal shelter even offers to take dogs for a walk. -> you saved money for your essentials
2. You can't afford food. This seems like a big one but in reality there's always cheap stuff that'll fill your stomach. Rice. Beans. Certain veggies and fruit as well. And most of the time there are special offers on some animal products as well. And even if you can't afford those, in most towns there is some sort of charity often run by religious institutes that will give away food for free, no questions asked. Yes it sucks to be dependent on others but we are social beings and there are more people willing to help than you might think. - > you saved money for rent and insurance.
3. You can't afford rent. okay, maybe you can share your apartment or move back to your parents.

kriolabrazuka,"Mental health professionals are humans too. That said, I would proceed with caution regarding continuing this therapist-patient relationship.

lostinspace_12,"Therapist here ‚Äî don‚Äôt bring her flowers or gifts. Our code of ethics state we‚Äôre not supposed to accept gifts. Sometimes we make small exceptions if there‚Äôs not a big financial tie to it, but some of us are adamant about not accepting anything from people, especially consumable items.

My suggestion, as someone who has been on both sides of this, just talk to her. You shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to manage your therapist‚Äôs feelings, and it seems like this has changed the dynamic which could affect how much you‚Äôre willing to open up in the future. It would be a good idea to talk to her about your reaction to her crying, so she can do the work to prevent it from happening again, so she can help you feel more comfortable, and so you both can decide if it‚Äôll be a good fit moving forward.

Sometimes this just happens where we shed a few tears with our clients, and that‚Äôs okay! But sometimes this is a sign that your story may be hitting too close to home which could possibly impact her ability to treat you effectively without bias.",2023-01-19 06:25:34,10fz1qi

Wanderingnotlost121,"2 cents from another therapist here, it's perfectly normal to feel bad for what happened, but remember that you didn't do anything wrong. Different therapists have different levels of emotional expression when working with patients, and the theory and approach to that professionally is a topic for another day.

  
I would encourage you to check in to how it made you feel during the session, and if you feel that it became a distraction or a barrier to the purposes you hoped to achieve. If I'm hearing you correctly, you came in with a specific need that was not fully addressed, and frankly that is an issue. I would discuss it openly with her if you plan on seeing her again. Use a simple format like ""Last time we talked (insert what happened) and it make me feel (insert how it made you feel), and it concerns me because (insert concern)."" and see if that helps line both of you up.",2023-01-19 13:56:04,10fz1qi

Reave-Eye,"Ask her about it next session. ‚ÄúI noticed last session that you seemed tearful and sniffly when I was talking about X. Just curious if something I said upset you, or made you sad, or was it allergies?‚Äù

Don‚Äôt give her a gift, as others have suggested. You don‚Äôt owe her anything, regardless of the reason why she was tearful. The nature of the therapist-patient relationship is asymmetrical ‚Äî they‚Äôre there to listen to you and care for you while managing their own emotions, and you should not bear any responsibility for managing their emotions. This is very important to establish in order to have a functioning therapeutic relationship, so don‚Äôt muddy the waters further by trying to ‚Äúmake up‚Äù for upsetting her. You haven‚Äôt done anything wrong to warrant an apology or a gift.

In fact, from a therapist‚Äôs perspective, she should really initiate a conversation about the ethical boundary crossing on her end. I know it sounds weird, but she really shouldn‚Äôt be openly crying in session specifically *because* it places you as the patient in this odd position of feeling the urge to comfort your therapist (which, again, is not how this relationship should work). Now, she might not have been crying, but regardless, it would be best practice for her to open a dialogue about her tearfulness so that the boundaries around this issue can be clarified. She should also make sure that she is taking care of herself adequately so that she can manage her affect appropriately in session with you. In many cases, a therapist crying in response to patient disclosure is a red flag for professional burnout. She may be so overwhelmed that she can‚Äôt sufficiently manage her own internal state and prevent it from spilling over into the session, which would be a big problem in terms of her ability to serve your needs as a patient.

So yeah, don‚Äôt buy her a gift. It won‚Äôt make the situation any better and will only make boundaries even less clear than they already are.

also a good alternative to cutting is rubber bands! when i was trying to stop i'd wear rubber band and when i'd wanna cut you just pull it out however far you want and ouchie lol it's good so you're still getting that relief/distraction/endorphins from the pain.

And try to make her understand the difference between healthy pain(such as gymming, sports etc) and unhealthy pain(like cutting herself). Tell her that ofc pain is indeed a very good coping mechanism but you have to choose such a way to generate pain which in the long term will make you physically and mentally stronger and not affect your health.

Stifton,"I'm nowhere near an expert on this but I saw a girl talking on tiktok about using sensory bags with fidget toys and other widgets meant for people with autism and sour sweets to help when she starts feeling like harming. She does this to sort of trick her brain into thinking about a sensation and focusing on her body and senses as opposed to her feelings of being overwhelmed and recurring thoughts of hurting herself. It seemed like she was finding some success with it along with therapy and other support.

I cut for 10 years of my life and only completely stopped because I had my son. DBT helped me decrease a lot. For me, showers were great. I would just sit in there until the water got cold (no a bath was not the same I don't know why). It also helped to draw on myself when I felt like cutting, so maybe get her an array of markers and put them everywhere. Make them more accessible than sharp things, but if she is determined to harm herself for that adrenaline release, she'll find a way. I still have urges at times, but I know now that I just need to be with people at that time. Stay calm if she does slip up and continue to be open to talking.

engelthefallen,"I had a history of cutting.  Did it when I was having panic attacks that went diagnosed for ages.  Once that go diagnosed and I got meds stopped entirely.  

Keep an eye on cutting as it starts superficial, but sometimes either something is sharper than you think and you get really messed up.  Also in the online self-harm community many have a habit of cutting deep to the fat layer, which is not exactly superficial anymore and should ideally be stitched shut.",2023-04-25 11:37:36,12y5qp6
jojolyne_v,"I was a self harmer for 20 years (ages 9 to 29) and have currently been in remission for 2.5 years


I've found the best thing to avoid relapsing is to replace it with hobbies that provide a similar amount of adrenaline and endorphins such as High Intensity Interval Training


Right now I do this via Dance Dance Revolution and Stepmania, as well as hiking and training to backpack


This year I am ready to start doing 20km+ trails outdoors


When I was a teenager I would compete in figure skating in the winter and mountain bike a couple hours a day in the summer, however I would relapse when stuck in school because people bullied me pretty relentlessly, and I didn't want to get into fights so I'd take it out on myself, that's how it started


Having a good support system and a therapist can help in this regard too, giving enough self-worth to avoid taking it out on oneself

It's difficult to get to that point, but having a hobby that takes a long time to gradually build up on -- such as painting and/or playing RPGs can help in this regard, help show that you can gradually maintain progress through consistency rather than giving in to impulsive urges of self-harm

papaslilpoppyseed,"So many comments have already said a majority of what needs to be said. I wanted to step in and just say what a wonderful, supporting mother you're being. I know it must be hard to see your baby hurting, but it's good that it was caught early and that you're taking steps to help her. 

I (26F) started self harming (intentionally) when I was 12. My circumstances were *very* different- I lived in an abusive home where I was forced to raise three children from an even younger age. My sister died, and my mom committed suicide, and my own mental health was very, very bad. When my parents found out, I was yelled at and hit, my father turned the water on as hot as he could get it and used a washcloth to forcefully scrub soap into my wounds, which opened them further, and then poured alcohol over them, all while telling me that I was a horrible child and this was all my fault. My stepmom took to doing ""body checks"", but only when she was mad at me- it was less about the cutting/burning/bruising and more about humiliating me. She would force me to get naked and stand still while she looked over my whole body and poked at me and it was awful. It only ever made things worse. I didn't stop self harming until about 3 years ago, and it's still a struggle everyday. 

I saw in one comment that you think she might be doing this very late at night when she can't sleep. Maybe it would help her if she was given verbal permission to get out of bed and do things if she felt the need to self harm. I know that sounds kind of silly, but a lot of kids are taught that nighttime is meant for sleep, and when they have anxious or intrusive thoughts, they feel that they're stuck just drowning in them. Some ideas that have helped me a little:
- Get her a coarse paintbrush and a few things of acrylic paint- the courseness will provide a ""dragging"" sensation and the paint gives the sensation of first being wet and kind of drippy and then drying out and cracking a little, she can even pick at the paint over a towel or drop cloth. This also provides a creative outlet- at first I just did it for the sensory aspect, but eventually it became a time where I could paint something beautiful, or get some words off my chest, I was free to just let it out and then wash it down the drain! 
- Tell her she's allowed to take showers/baths late at night if she needs some comfort or something
- Get some audiobooks she'd like, or just books if she's a reader. Or try to find a podcast she likes! I've found that listening helps me a lot because I feel less alone, and I have to focus a little more to comprehend so the other little voices tend to quiet down
- Figure out a sort of quiet but mentally stimulating hobby she can slowly work on at her own pace- diamond paintings, puzzles, reverse coloring books, crocheting, embroidery
- Let her bake at night (I used to do this so often, it just helped clear my head and keep me busy- plus everyone had a nice treat to wake up to which made me feel good)

Maybe you could also allow her to wake you up if she really needs you. You could even take her outside for a short walk and a chat, or just be next to her for awhile. That could help ease her mind and allow her to sleep. 

Anyways, I just thought I'd throw some ideas out there!!! I wish you both the best of luck üíñ",2023-04-25 14:24:37,12y5qp6

balladonn,"Cutting to relieve stress? Hmm. Sounds familiar.  Oh wait I did that. Good news is, she knows it's wrong, doesn't want to hurt herself badly, and is open with you about it. It may not stop right away, so be sure to press cleanliness! Make sure whatever is being used is clean, and to clean the area before and after. I know it sounds terrible, but from my own experience,  cleanliness is important.  If it's not a suicide attempt, let's make sure it doesn't become one by infection. Not a good way to go. I'd also advise telling her to keep the cuts in certain areas, so she doesn't nick arteries or cause more damage than wanted. Again, I know it sounds like I'm advocating it. I'm not. I'm saying making sure it's done as safely as possible until it stops is important.  From my experience,  more dull blades than sharp. There's more pain, and less cut. If it's not suicidal, it's a out the pain. It makes you feel in control of yourself. Rage, fear, emotional pain, it eases a bit when you cut. The goal is to find other outlets. Maybe the gym, a punching bag, a place to scream. When I say scream, I mean let it ALL out. Warning, the screaming thing will sound...terrifying. most people describe it as a wail of death. Tears fly, many lose their voice for a while. But you have to let it all out somehow. Other than through the pain of the cuts. She's strong. She can make it through this. So are you. Don't you dare give up, and don't you dare think less of yourself. Tell her the same thing. There's my two cents, I'll shut up.",2023-04-25 15:31:38,12y5qp6

Where_is_my_dopamine,"Howdy. I‚Äôm a doctor (31) who used to self-harm and generally trash his body with drugs and alcohol. I know it‚Äôs a difficult thing to grasp but many people do cut themselves out of not a desire to suicide but to just feel something else. That doesn‚Äôt necessarily make it any less dangerous but she seems like she‚Äôs being pretty transparent around it. 

I think your best bet is to keep doing what you‚Äôre doing and try not to make it a huge deal, yet. Keep an eye on her, be present, spend as much time with her as possible and check in with her regularly. Follow the therapists advice but don‚Äôt make any drastic changes at home. Young people are suffering from mental illness at a younger and younger age. It‚Äôs also caught up in the whole ‚Äòsocial media woe-is-us‚Äô romanticisation of mental illness that‚Äôs seemingly defining the last few years of the teen experience.

Also wanted to rieterate and point out that you should not limit her ability to access ‚Äútools‚Äù for self injury. This can lead to people injuring themselves worse than they intend to because they are unfamiliar with the the tools they are used to.

Jamaqius,"I used to cut when my depression was really bad. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre a balloon & all the stress & depression is making you burst, but a cut feels like letting some of the air out.
I‚Äôve found certain things help me avoid it, physically pounding it out is the best, go for a run, play an aggressive sport or something like that, it just expends all this pent up emotion.
If that‚Äôs not possible or preferable extreme shower temperatures worked for me too. I prefer a hot shower so I made it really hot, blasted some heavy metal & had a really thorough shower & then the need was gone. Cold works well too but I like the heat. I also was told holding ice cubes helps because it has the temperature change & a bit of pain that is controlled & not permanently damaging in any way.

Shortsub,"When I used to cut it was about control.  I felt like I had no control over anything in my life, but I could control my own pain and my own bleeding.  It was like an immediate way to calm down.  I'm just telling you this because *maybe* that has something to do with the way she feels so trying to give some insight.  Is she having trouble in school?  Or is there anything that may be triggering this.  Or is it something that she really has no legitimate answer for.  It has to be more than just stress even if she doesn't know it.  I had underlying health issues that needed to be addressed before I could stop,   I do suggest getting her not just into a therapist (they don't do medication) but a psychiatrist as well (they do the medication) because if she's cutting she probably does need some sort of medical intervention to stop it.

Limiting access doesn't stop the temptation. The temptation will still be there, it'd just be removing the outlet for it, which might not be a good thing.

Point is, limiting access is more dangerous because it forces you to get creative when you relapse, and that's a bad thing because you'll realize just how many things/objects around you you can manipulate to be used as a sub for the blade.

expat_mel,"That's a great idea! It could be something traditionally ""calming,"" like meditation or yoga, or you can show her what you already do to relieve stress - cook, journal, listen to music, whatever. Whether you start a new activity together or invite her into your world to join you in an activity you already do, it's also an amazing opportunity to further bond with her, which could help counter some of the negative thoughts or feelings she's dealing with. I also think it was a really good idea to bring her to work with you today - she got time with you, she got to feel protected and not alone, and you invited her into your world. 

Echoing what many others have said, your reaction was what any kid struggling with their emotions wants to hear, and the fact that you're already doing everything you can to get her the help she needs is incredible. A+ parenting, and just A+ being an amazing person. Good luck with everything and I hope your girl gets all the help she needs to live her best life. (And kudos to your son for letting you know. If you haven't, I'd suggest thanking him for being honest with you since ""snitching"" is so looked down upon by kids, especially if he's her age or younger. Make sure he knows that he did the right thing by looking out for her.)",2023-04-25 17:11:07,12y5qp6
AmeslJ55,"If a parent knows their child is cutting and they don't make a reasonable effort to remove the risk, by law that is neglect and she can get into trouble. There are things people can do other than cut that can provide the same physical sensations or release without the level of danger cutting can have. This is coming from a licensed therapist who did also use to self-harm as a teen. Yes, it does provide some relief and is beneficial for some people. If it wasn't people wouldn't do it. You're correct, most of the time it is not a suicidal attempt or causes severe physical harm, however it can and people's thresholds for the pain can increase, meaning they need more cuts in order to have the same relief, or they begin cutting in more dangerous places on the body. No offense as obviously I've been a teen before, teens don't have the cognitive ability to appreciate long-term consequences and are, as developmental psychology teaches us, are much more impulsive than adults, which is why adults must implement boundaries and safety measures. 
Plus, if child does become actively suicidal and has access to objects they can use to harm themselves, and the parent knows this, that is irresponsible. Right now the immediate concern is safety and providing a productive (providing alternatives to cutting) and safe environment for the child until they're able to get professional help.",2023-04-25 13:44:05,12y5qp6
[deleted],"M17 btw , in my case i was also insecure, but was insecure for some reason such as being lonely, not being able to get into a relationship, not being loved, ik shes still 13 and young for these things (not saying am ready for them ) but is there any reasons she‚Äôs feeling this way? Or just general feelings ? If its for a specific reason try and support her and make her feel better as well as improving her problem if possible, for me i got mostly over that stage alone so maybe you being there speeds up the process. Let her go out, assign simple tasks or in other words start small with your tasks and encourage her and appreciate her work as small as it is. Be patient and supportive: Remember that healing takes time and effort, and your daughter may need your patience and support along the way. Encourage her to take things at her own pace and reassure her that you are there for her no matter what.

Remember, it's important to be gentle with yourself and your daughter during this process. With patience, understanding, and support, your daughter can learn to overcome her insecurities and find new ways to cope with her emotions.",2023-04-25 12:33:45,12y5qp6
WontonBogeyman,"I agree, there still needs to be an outlet though rather than sitting alone in a mental abyss. It was just the way you worded it that I wanted to comment on - the temptation is there regardless of her surroundings. 

Whether it's rubber bands on the wrist or whatever there still needs to be something there as that outlet. 

OP was looking for things to do with her daughter - personally I'd suggest nature walks if any are around. Getting off the sofa is the hardest part of it, most people wont want to take time out of their day to go out and get sweaty but afterwards you'll feel better and it could be a good bonding activity with OP and daughter.

And no one can change that thought process. The only thing I've found that works is medication. You did everything you could. Know that you tried to help. It will be hard at first to get through the days. But it will start to ease and be bearable. Get yourself into therapy and talk about it.

I wouldn't draw an impassable line between ""escapism vs real life"". Escapism can be riding bicycle, doing outdoor hobbies, working hard and with passion on something. Basically anything that is not ""just prolonging your existence in relative comfort"".

I have taken a break from reading or watching anything that makes me commit for a long time. I avoid eating alone with Netflix because that added to the problem. And whenever I have this urge to ignore my surroundings I make it a point that I socialise with someone. I have gotten into a lot of trouble all my life but I had some great supportive people who made it a point to pull me back to reality
 But most of all I worked on the issues that made me want to escape. That is the only way to fix this.",2023-01-18 16:13:19,10ff113
RWPossum,"I'll share some ideas, hopefully there's something useful for you here.  
  
There's a lot of talk about maladaptive daydreaming, which is daydreaming to the point that it interferes with a person's daily life. This is not officially recognized as a disorder but some people are getting therapy for it. An expert recommends going to a support group online, such as Wild Minds Network.  
  
  
Maybe what's best for you is depression treatment. A lot of things can help, mostly things that are easy. My recent comments have advice from experts about standard treatments and the self-help recommended by therapists. Feel free to click on my name and read.  
  
  
When people talk about being bored with real life, my guess is that this has a lot to do with not liking work. When people can get satisfaction out of work, that's one of the best things they can possibly have. How do people in general do this? I don't have an answer but I know that there are people who have been studying this. Do a YouTube search.",2023-01-18 17:15:07,10ff113
Conscious_Reason_510,"Same. Tough world we live in. It's hard to get motivated, and it seems so boring in comparison to the ideals or extremes we read about, watch, or game in.

So let's just keep going until we find those paths forward.",2023-01-18 20:43:34,10ff113
Longjumping_Aide_681,I love escapism. I use to use alcohol for extreme escapism. I‚Äôm sober now so I‚Äôm using books as well. It‚Äôs so much better being distracted.,2023-01-18 22:30:13,10ff113
teamsaxon,"I feel the same when I am in a depressive slump.

I ditch real world responsibility so I can game and get to see what happens next in the story, or I'll watch a TV series and get totally enamoured in the fandom side of things. Feels terrible when it's over bc then you don't have anything left and you are at odds with what to do with yourself.

I think escapism is a normal part of modern life. Look at how the world is, I think it's totally fair to want to escape it. I've felt like this for years (aside from when I was at uni), always found myself getting lost in things like Star Trek, Doctor Who, certain video games. You name it. I yearn to live in those fictitious worlds as it seems so exciting and amazing. I don't have an answer to all of this, probably should ask my therapist üòÇ",2023-01-18 23:48:01,10ff113

OKRRRRR,"So glad I came across this. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve kinda fleeting recognised as a habit I engage in and have since being a child, but this hit me like a ton of bricks hahaha.

My suggestion: therapy‚Ä¶ and lots of it i.e. continued. I just finished TRTP for CPTSD and it worked really well for me and reduced my need to do this. 

Meds also helped (prescription cannabis and CBD oil for me) but acknowledge they also feel like a bit of a check out. Just started seeing a psychiatrist and excited to see how ADHD meds might help with the CPTSD symptoms (apparently they work for CPTSD as the symptoms are so similar to ADHD) and how that may impact my need to check out. 

Also, is checking out even a bad thing? I don‚Äôt think it is, but then, I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI could‚Äôve got so much done with that time‚Äù, but also, it‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou work 50 hour weeks, it‚Äôs fine to have 2 days off‚Äù.

Just-Drew-It,"I have a ""very high"" level of immersion when consuming movies and books. When I was younger, I would watch movies multiple times in a row because a strong surge of sadness and anxiety would wash over me when the movie credits would roll up.

It was quite unsettling, actually and too hard to properly articulate the emotion in a paragraph. But I feel your pain!",2023-01-18 22:42:08,10ff113

When I get into a piece of media (movie franchise or comics) I become obsessed with it for a few days. Every time I pick up a new series or book I try to pace myself but end up binging the whole thing in days. The guilt and negative effects of avoiding responsibilities add up to a boring life with no socialising, which make me want to escape into something again. It's hell lol.",2023-01-19 02:52:20,10ff113

pharaohess,"I sometimes have this problem and whenever it hits, I try to use the escapism as a buffer and then bite off chunks of reality when I am able, sort of easing into it and using the escapism to take the edge off. Dealing with reality is something you need to practice. It actually does often suck as well, so it‚Äôs not always easy, even if your life is ‚Äúokay‚Äù or ‚Äúfine‚Äù.

The other thing that I have done is to transfer things from the places I escape to into my everyday life. I like fantasy novels, so I surrounded myself with little tender mushrooms and twigs, live like a hobbit, bake honey cakes and sit on the floor to eat them. 

The thing I realized is that the escapism gave me cool ideas for ways to make my own life more fun and engaging. It often seems like when you come back to reality you just have to wear hoodies and get an office job but what I realized upon becoming an adult is that I am actually in charge of my own life and can find ways to make it work the way I want it to.

When I was younger, I used to throw these weird parties. For one of them, me and my friend pretended to be these tea house robots and invited a bunch of people over. We wore these futuristic costumes and made up this tea ceremony that we thought the robots would perform. People read poems while drinking tea. It was fun. We called it a Poetea and Jam party.

Being able to become a weirdo without feeling bad about it was the best decision I ever made. You might lose a few of your more timid and normal friends but might also gain a lot of other weirdos who also want to have fun with you.",2023-01-19 05:26:32,10ff113

redsungryphon,"I'm seconding this. I struggle so badly with this and I have High functioning ADHD. Medication boosted my grades and ability to structure my work coherently.

If you can, setting yourself timers, making to-do-lists broken right down into smaller tasks and setting up reward systems for yourself. When I study I either go somewhere I know my brain cannot be distracted by the stuff at home. Sometimes life doesn't allow this but I try my best. 

It's almost physically painful at times to cut yourself into a routine. I lack the motivation to do the study work I do at the moment, because it's got 0 benefits immediately and I get no feedback. So anxiety quickly murders any sense of accomplishment or progress. If it wasn't for having some major DNA level feral spite against failing to get where I want to be.

But on the other, this could make him more hesitant to open up in the future, feeling like he can't speak about this with anyone without the cops showing up.  That's about where I am at this point.  It works, but only once. 

It's really a lose lose situation: I'm not sure which option makes people safer in the long run.  

Now as for his reaction, it isn't fair for him to say he'll never forgive you, and I don't think that's true.  You definitely had his best interests in mind, and he might have done the same thing, had the roles been reversed. 


It looks like you are asking for advice, so I'd say you should give him space but still check in, maybe in a few days.  Just don't think his safety is on you: that wouldn't be fair at all.

claraharlow,"You did the right thing.

I've definitely been in that place before. I spoke to a friend about some concerning things and freaked her out and she sent the cops to check on me. I was frustrated and embarrassed and hated her for a while. I was too deep in my mental illness to see that she cared and worried and wanted me to be okay. Sometimes intervention can feel like intrusion to someone struggling with stuff this deep. I know it did to me. These thoughts and feelings are incredibly isolating and warp your perception of reality, and most people in this situation keep it to themselves and feel when it's exposed, even to save their life, its a violation of trust. Most people think they can handle it themselves, and they can't.

It's definitely not an easy decision to make, and your friend is allowed to feel upset or betrayed, but I wouldn't want a friend to hear me speak about hurting myself and decide to sit back and not do anything about it. I'm grateful for my friend who called for help for me when we were only kids. I'm in a better place now and hopefully your friend will be soon too.

kesselbang,"Something very similar recently happened to me: I can only really offer advice from my perspective.
I cut contact with my abusive, dysfunctional family when I was in my early 20's. I had 3 siblings, 2 of which were also very problematic due: the 3rd was still a minor at the time, and living with the abusive parents, and while I woukd have maintained contact with him if it was possible to do so and keep us both safe: unfortunately, it wasn't 
25 or so years later, he found me again via the chat service on a blogging site, and asked if we could start rebuilding our relationship (we had been very close) I took some time to think about it, and because he was now living independently, and also had no contact with the other family members, I agreed; but said that if he ever did anything to make me regret reconnecting with him, he'd never hear from me again.

We talked online a lot. Both of us were extremely badly affected by our horrible experiences growing up, and both had some serious mental health problems as well as PTSD and other isdues; but were able to get back some of our previous closeness, and Ibtried to be a supportive big sister, and help where I could.

Then last year, their messages became darker. They talked about how hard it was for them to go on. How they no longer wanted to struggle and fight; and had dreams about ending things. Obviously that caused me a lot of anxiety and concern for them, and I made even more if an effort to tell them how important they were to me. 
Then, in April of last year, it came to a head. Force weeks, I'd had message after message telling me he had a plan in place: and detailing how he would end things. What he wanted/didn't want in regard to a funeral. He got mad at me for calling him out on being aggressively unpleasant to me, and accused me of ""not allowing him to be unwell""  All I'd said was that while I understood that he was unwell and struggling, it didn't give him a free pass to attack me, and I was not ok or happy with him for doing it.
A few days later, I get a phone call. A 15 minute, incoherent phone call which consisted of nothing but sobbing: the only word I could make out during the entire calk, was ""sorry"" which he repeated many times iver the call. I was trying to get him to tell me what was wrong: had something happened: did he need help,?  I told him over and over that I was here, and I loved him: that I was listening. That if he needed help  he didn't have to try to talk: just tap the mic on the phone. Nothing; just incoherent sobbing, then he hung up
Now this was someone who did not make voice calls in any format. Everything was done via text or messaging platforms. He could not have people in his home. I tried over and over to get a response from him; he wouldn't answer calls or messages anywhere. I live over 50 miles away from him, and I don't drive, or have antidepressant who could have driven me. I was completely frantic, thinking that the call was him telling me he was in the process of harming himself. So, after an hour of fruitless attempts to reach him, and telling him I needed to get help to him, I made a call to the police in his area for a safe and well check.
Six hours later  I am finally able to get through to one of the police officers, who tells me the brother is perfectly OK. By that time, I was a wreck

A week or so layer, I receive not one, but two letters, multiple pages each, of raging abuse about how I'd betrayed him by sending people to his house, and ""discussing his medical issues with strangers"" : ranting about how much I'd hurt him, and that I shoukd consider him dead anyway, because I was dead to him from that moment on; then telling me to never contact him again.

My advice;  you, just like me  did the right - and only - thing that you could do, out of concern for that person. Its their choice how to respond to that. You can't control how they react, or how they feel. 
I've given the brother what he so clearly asked for  and deleted his number, blocked him everywhere, and made sure anyone else why may have contact with him, that he is never to have contact with me again.

Give your friend time, and space to figure out what they want. If you do want to continue the friendship in some form, let them know that you're happy for them to reach out to you if and when they're ready: but don't push; din't chase them  and after you leave the ball in their court, leave it there. Their anger may be a knee-jerk reaction due to embarrassment: it may be a part of their illness. Just be prepared to accept that they may not reach out to you, and move on. Your concern and compassion for them is why you tried to help: that does not make you a bad person, no matter what they might tell you",2023-04-24 05:59:58,12w98bl

I lost a friend almost the same way.  My girlfriend's husband left her and she was off the chain and talking about killing herself.   I tried, like you, to calm her down, but then she went offline and wouldn't answer texts or calls.  I sent the police to her place but she had left.  So I was left wondering and panicking about what happened.   I, like you as well, have mental illness and a long history or suicidal ideation and attempts so this really negatively affected me.  Thanks to my husband I was able to calm down and work through some things and stay safe.  And like a week later my friend calls me and is upset I didn't check on her after the first day.  I tried to explain my side but she didn't want to hear it and hung up on me.  So it's now been 18 months and while I still miss the relationship I feel I'm better off without them in my life.

cancerinventor,"I‚Äôve been in your friends situation. Before I was diagnosed bipolar, but after I started getting some help for my ‚Äúdepression‚Äù. I was on meds that are beneficial to people with depression or anxiety, but really bad for people with bipolar disorder. Friend knew I was getting help, but also saw that the help was making things worse for me. 

On the anniversary of my father death, I drank too much, and she called and I expressed some negative thoughts, how hopeless I was feeling, and how I wasn‚Äôt interested in speaking with her - in that moment. She ended up calling the police, and I was 5150ed despite my protests and the fact that I clearly wasn‚Äôt a threat to anyone including myself. 

I got out and stopped speaking to her. I understood why she did it, and that she cared, but I thought it was an extreme betrayal of trust considering I had mentioned multiple previous negative encounters with the police. 

A few months later, I started to get treatment for bipolar disorder. And I started to feel normal. I stopped having thoughts of suicide. I thought that it would make me more understanding and sympathetic, I was certainly more appreciative of my friends for dealing with me while I put them through hell. But I never forgave her for that. And we don‚Äôt speak anymore. At one point, I considered her my best friend, and thought we would be friends till we die. We were friends for years in college. 

For me personally, I have expressed how negative my attitudes and feelings are for the police, and how little I‚Äôd like to interact with them. It was something we talked about often enough. If a social worker had come by, and I ended up getting committed, I would‚Äôve forgiven her. But it was the police, and she knew how much I hate police. 

Leave your friend alone. Give them space, and if he forgives you and you want to be friends with him still, that‚Äôs awesome. But if he decides not to speak to you again, we‚Äôll then YOU fucked up, and YOU wronged your friend. The truth about it is that intentions don‚Äôt mean much. It doesn‚Äôt matter how good your intentions were, it seems like you hurt him. That‚Äôs reality.

Now this is not the same, but I used to have an ex who would use the self harm and suicide hints and threats as a way to garner pity. That is not to say they wheren't hurting, they clearly where. but it was the whole ""if you break up with me I will do X"" or ""if you don't respond to my calls I will cut myself"". basically emotional blackmail. So I sendt the messages to their parents and just blocked them. Reason why I bring this up - is that you might understand the pain and frustration other people are going through due to your own things. But that doesn't mean that you need to be the one who talks them through it and helps them. If it causes you distress or makes you feel bad, then passing the buck so to say, to their family or to the authrorities is the correct way to go about it.

meanietemp,"This is the best answer tbh. 

As someone who has been on both sides of this situation, nobody is in the wrong here. You were afraid for his life and he put that on you knowingly, that‚Äôs not a situation anyone should ever have to be in. 

That being said, wellness checks are carried out by police officers most of the time. They aren‚Äôt trained mental health professionals, and they are more often than not trained to use force rather than deescalate. In a situation with someone who is threatening to end their life, especially if a weapon is involved or they aren‚Äôt being cooperative, it‚Äôs common for people to end up being forcibly restrained and committed against their will. Sometimes sedatives are used. 

It can be incredibly traumatic. It sounds like everything ended up being fine in his case, but it‚Äôs likely that the situation was scary for him given the implications. It‚Äôs completely understandable that he feels the way he does- though I also think you didn‚Äôt do anything bad or wrong and you shouldn‚Äôt beat yourself up too much.

I know it‚Äôs hard to lose a friend, but sometimes there are situations that just aren‚Äôt cut and dry. You obviously care about him, so give him time. Leave him alone. He might come around, he might not.

Wearehealing,"I‚Äôve spent most of my life caring for my mentally I‚Äôll friends, and I can honestly say if they discard you or put you through so much pain and then cut you off. I might come off as a horrible friend tho, this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù, her ‚Äúbest friend ‚Äú, might not be truly a good friend at all. The best thing she could have ever do was get help and she has no control over the reactions, and I don‚Äôt think she should beg or reconnect with someone that is that sick. Our culture teaches us to allow very sick people in our lives and go through all their mess, I‚Äôve been with friends that have attempted suicide on and on and on, and I‚Äôve taken them to pump their stomachs, or been above and beyond trying to help them, against my own well-being even. So it might come off as brutally harsh. Tho, friends are not professionals and friendships should be mutual and should not be about making someone sick of codependency. she did the best she could and now she is feeling guilty and begging love and putting herself in a position where her own self worth and self steem and emotional safety is suffering. That is not in the long run and at all, a good standard, is not a healthy space, can lead to her own mental health detriment.
