Some random guy saved my life today and he didn’t even realize it,"So I hit rock bottom months ago, but I brought a shovel with me and I’ve been getting worse and worse. I wrote my suicide note this morning and my plan was to take my pistol and end it all tonight when I got home from work. I had everything planned and I was set. Then this evening I was at work delivering pizzas. I went to this one house and I wasn’t sure if I was at the right address or not but there was a man in the driveway and I asked him if I was at the right address. He said he wasn’t sure because it was his bosses house, not his, and he was only there to pick up his car. Then we started talking and he mentioned how I was smiling. He spoke about how he was 63 years old, he was a military veteran, and how with people my age he doesn’t see people smile like I did. It was a fake smile I put on so when I greet customers it’s a good experience. But he picked up on my smile, we chatted and he was making me laugh, he ended up giving me a big hug and was telling me how I should appreciate my friends, my family, and life. This guy had no clue I was depressed and suicidal and was planning on taking my life 3 hours later, yet he still told me all of this. He ended up giving me some cheese he had (I didn’t eat it) but the reason why he gave it to me is because  the packaging had a huge smile on it and he told me to have it and to keep on smiling and spreading positivity. 

This guy was only at the house to pick up his car, he was only there for 5 minutes, yet in that 5 minutes is when I showed up. If that delivery was 5 minutes earlier or 5 minutes later I would have already taken my life, but the timing was perfect, and I’m still here. I’m not a super religious person, but I truly believe this man was my saving grace, he was sent by god to let me know it’s not my time to go. I gotta keep fighting. 

I got his bosses phone number from the side of the work truck that was sitting in the driveway and I plan on calling him tomorrow and letting him know this story and asking him to thank his employee for me. 

God is real and he sent this man to save my life",taquitotaco,10bbq3d,584,50,2023-01-13 17:28:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/10bbq3d/some_random_guy_saved_my_life_today_and_he_didnt/,False,False,False
Saw someone die yesterday,"Yesterday while I getting on the bus after work , a boy that was getting off stepped into traffic without looking and got hit by a car that sent him flying in front of the bus. It happened so fast that I didn’t even finish paying for my ticket yet. Everyone came up to try and help him until the ambulance got there but the amount of blood and how far the car launched him, I knew he wasn’t going to make it. The EMTs got there, checked his pulse and immediately got him on the stretcher and used the defibrillators. The ambulance rode off. No sirens. No lights. No nothing. I got up and just walked back to my job in total shock. All I could and have been thinking about is the brief couple of seconds where I was able to see him before he died. Looked like a teenager and he looked like he just got off of work himself. I especially remember his long dreadlocs because some of them had ripped out and was laying in the street. Tried to tell my family what I saw and it seemed like no one cared, especially my mom. She seemed more upset that she had to come pick me up while she doing Lyft. After the shock faded I thought I was okay until I tried going to sleep. That entire part of my day kept playing back on loop. Couldn’t sleep so tried watching tv but I couldn’t pay attention to what was going on. Then I started thinking about all the times I’ve stepped into the street without thinking for hours. My body eventually gave out and went to sleep. Woke up feeling like shit so I asked my mom for a ride to work. During the ride she asked me why I looked depressed. Didn’t say anything. Then she asked me if I was able to complete some chore yesterday and when I said no she started going off on me. Telling me that I’m lazy and I don’t care about anything. I got angry and yelled at her and told her imma still fucked up from yesterday and she told me to “toughen up and leave that shit in the past. You didn’t know him “ after that I asked her to just drop me off wherever because I just was sick of her attitude. I eventually got to work but I had to walk past the spot he got hit at. I cried. Couldn’t help it. Felt like a total bitch but I just couldn’t help it. My entire shift was just me mourning a total stranger. I know it’s probably stupid but it’s just how I am. Wanted to get this off my chest because I don’t really have anyone to really vent about this to.",kellwashere45,1347s6u,559,109,2023-04-30 17:31:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1347s6u/saw_someone_die_yesterday/,False,False,False

My mom just committed suicide,"I haven’t talked to her in a while, and now I’m beating myself up about it. My mom had bipolar disorder. My dad just last month told me that she had been acting crazy.

"In my opinion, I think schools, family, or people in general should start teaching kids about mental health at a much younger age","So I've had anxiety ever since I can remember. I was scared of going blind at 7 years old, scared the world was gonna end when I was 11, etc. I think I would've been much better off today if I was taught what anxiety was when I was much younger. Then I would know how to deal with it, learn that I wasn't crazy, and most of all, get the help I needed before my brain was fully developed. 
In my opinion, I think with the amount of people in the world that struggle with some type of mental illness, kids should start learning about them at a much younger age so that their world doesn't fall apart one day and they have no idea why or how to deal with it. So many people are also too afraid to ask for help because they are embarrassed, scared of being judged, or don't have the money/resources for help. Just imagine how many people could've benefited from being helped earlier on, how many people could've been saved.
And honestly, I've heard the whole ""let the kids have a childhood,"" but honestly, the kids who need a talk about mental health lost their childhood a long time ago.",Individual_Pickle_26,11sry7b,464,34,2023-03-16 04:55:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/11sry7b/in_my_opinion_i_think_schools_family_or_people_in/,False,False,False

I just survived a murder attempt by my own mother and i need help,"Hello everyone,  
  
I'm a 20-year-old woman from Newcastle, UK, and I'm reaching out for help. When I was 16, I moved to the UK with my mother from Poland, and since then, life has been a constant struggle.  
  
My father left us when I was young, and I haven't had any contact with him for years. My mother's severe mood swings resemble extreme bipolar episodes, but she refuses to seek any help, making my life even harder.  
  
Last year, I was prescribed Roaccutane for my acne, and things took a turn for the worse. Due to COVID, my doctor increased my dose without necessary blood tests, and I became extremely ill. My mother's refusal to pay for my treatment made things worse, and I was suicidal, but I managed to hang on.  
  
Yesterday, my mother had her worst episode yet. While drunk, she threatened me and got very close. Terrified for my safety, I locked the door behind her when she went outside to smoke. Shockingly, she set the garden on fire, knowing it would spread to the house and harm me.  
  
I called the police, and my mother is now in custody. I'm completely alone, with no support, money, or idea of how to move forward. I can't work or study because of my condition.  
  
I'm in desperate need of help and feeling hopeless and ill. i don't know how to survive financially and rebuild after my mother attempt to kill me. I need support

Held a child as he died,"
I held a child as he died yesterday. I work as an EMT-B running 911 calls on a medic unit. We had car crash with 3 deaths. Both parents and an infant. The one child was still alive when we arrived. We tried to very thing but unfortunately the child died. I don’t feel mentally fit to do anything at all. I haven’t eaten, drank showered, or anything but lay in my bed. All of my professors have been very supportive and understanding except for my chem professor. He said it’s “part of the job” and my mental health is not an excuse to miss an exam.

My dad saved my life and doesn’t know it,I (14m) was planning on killing myself due to extreme personal issues in my life as of right now. I was going to do it july of this year but it all changed when my dad called me into his room he asked if i was ok because i looked “weird” and wanted to know if i was ok and to let them know if anything was going on and if i was high (i was recently suspended for smoking weed) but even after i said i’m ok it’s almost like he knew something was going on because he went on a speech on how it’s important to be with God (he’s very close to God and im not) and to express your feelings but the thing that really got to me was when he said “listen if you don’t give a shit about yourself just please give a shit about us i can’t sleep thinking about what’s going on wondering if your ok” that really got to me because i never realized how badly i would’ve hurt my parents and my family if i would’ve done it.

15 minutes of exercise is better then 0,"I’m attempting to start exercising. I’m 19 and extremely overweight. I haven’t been exercising because of an injury I got awhile ago plus it’s just really hard to get up and going. My depression has been kicking my ass lately, and I’m starting to feel horrible because of my appearance, not to mention I get gender dysphoria.
I want to try exercising 15 minutes a day 3 times a week. A super small amount of time just sitting on the floor of my dorm stretching and doing planks/push-ups/whatever.
I always hate exercising. Especially cardio and running because it always makes me nauseous and want to puke and feels very painful.

Found out my daughter is cutting herself,"I (32F) just found out my (13F) daughter is cutting herself. She said it’s been going on for a little more than a week. Her brother was the one who told me.

She showed me them and they are superficial and don’t need immediate medical attention.

I tried to remain calm and just not overreact or panic. I let her know that I’m sorry she was feeling so strongly that she resorted to hurting herself and I let her know that I don’t think badly of her and I want to help her.

She agreed that she would like to get help so we are going to get a referral from her doctor for a therapist on Wednesday.

She said she does it to relieve stress and when she’s feeling upset but that it isn’t a suicide attempt. I let her know that we need to find another way for her to release stress since this is dangerous.
I took her with me to work and school today so we could spend some extra time together. 

I’m not sure what else I can do. I’m trying to keep it together but I do feel terrible that she is feeling so low. I wish I could take all her pain away.

Edit: *Update*
Thanks for all the support! Even though I tried my hardest to do what was best it still felt like I wasn’t doing enough so it was very reassuring reading through everyone’s comments and experiences. 

We got a referral from her pediatrician so now we are waiting for therapy. In the mean time we have been doing more activities together and she has been a lot more open to trying stuff. 

Yesterday was rough because I spent some one-on-one time with my son (9) and she felt a little betrayed after we were spending so much time together. At first she didn’t want to talk to me but eventually she came around and I told her it’s normal to feel that way and she’s still important even if I spend time with her brother. 

My son has ADHD (and possibly autism, we are in the process of getting an evaluation) so he has been getting a lot of attention and she explained how she felt like she was set aside. It was a great conversation because I had no idea she had felt that way because it always seemed like she wasn’t interested in spending time with me and she would decline most of the time. We are planning on doing some fitness activity together but we are still figuring out what, she wanted to weight lift but our local gyms don’t allow children under 15. 

She even stopped wearing her jacket which I felt like was huge so I think we are making good progress.

Escapism has taken over my life,"EDIT: thank you all for your comments. It was so nice to read and learn about other people’s experiences. However there is no need to speculate anymore because I was just diagnosed with inattentive ADHD lol.  

Ever since I was a child I have loved escapism. I love being immersed in different worlds and forgetting about the harsh realities of life for a bit. I'm now 22 and it feels like a coping mechanism in a way now. I wish I could consume media normally, but I become obsessed with it and it completely takes over my day to day life. Other people seem to love different TV shows and games but keep a balance between it and life outside of it. 

For example, I'm just coming off what I'm calling a ""book bender"" where I read two books back to back  in the span of a few days. I'm in university with a full course load and a part time job. I completely ignored all my responsibilities and assignments aside from going to work begrudgingly. I tried to go to class but I just ended up reading when I tried to pay attention and all I could think about was my book. I didn't make social plans with friends and I retreated into my room as soon as I got home. Now that I've finished the books I feel myself slipping into a depressive episode. This same pattern occurs with TV shows, video games, you name it. I'm so desperate to live a different life in these fictional stories. 

Ultimately I'm not sure what to do. I know it is not realistic to live life like this, as I already feel massive amounts of shame and guilt for basically checking out of the last week and I've had to wake up to the harsh reality of my life. It's not like my life is terrible either, it's a perfectly fine life with friends and my family but I just get so bored and frustrated and sad all the time with it.

thanks for listening, means a lot. I've never posted like this to reddit so I'm feeling a bit apprehensive.",kip1122,10ff113,292,79,2023-01-18 10:40:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/10ff113/escapism_has_taken_over_my_life/,False,1676418829.0,False
My friend says he’ll never forgive me because I called the authorities for a welfare check after he told me he was contemplating suicide,"

This morning, one of my best friends called me and was in tears. He spoke about frustration and suicidal ideation. As someone who suffers bipolar disorder, I completely  understood his pain and where he was coming from. I tried to calm him down but then he hung up on me. The last thing he said was “I’m really sorry. You won’t hear from me again very soon. Thank you for everything”
And then for thirty minutes, I tried to reach out to him but I couldn’t. I travelled out of the state for the weekend and I’m 3 hours away. He stays alone and I don’t know any of his neighbors so I was forced to ask the authorities to go to his house for a welfare check. 
They did and determined he was fine. He then called me and said he would never speak to me again or forgive me for doing that. But I couldn’t live with myself leaving him alone after talking about killing himself. I feel horrible like I betrayed his trust but another part of me feels like I did the right thing and maybe potentially saved his life. 
What do I do? He’s not relying my texts or calls. Should I go over to see him when I’m back? Should I keep trying to call and text him? Should I just leave him be?",Ki2525_,12w98bl,285,102,2023-04-23 06:46:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/12w98bl/my_friend_says_hell_never_forgive_me_because_i/,False,False,False

I am a broken man both mentally and physically. So I jumped on a bike and started pedalling across the country. I'm not stopping until I hit the other side.,"Hi everyone, 

About a month ago I started to think about Cycling across country, two weeks later I left Moncton NB at 1pm in the afternoon and haven't looked back, tomorrow I will cross into Quebec. 

I think this is interesting for a few reasons. 

1- As I said, I am fat and out of shape. I am 44m 6'5 320lbs and have not exercised in any meaningful way in 20 years. I have bad knees, bad back, apnea and I'm type 2 diabetic. 

2- Mentally, I'm broken. I suffer from really bad depression, bipolar 2 and Chemicaly Induced Anxiety Disorder. 

3- I was raised as a ward of the court, 30+ foster homes, street kid, jail, addiction. Been a hard road. 



So why on earth am I doing this? Two main reasons. First and foremost BC is my home province, they recently passed into law funding for school for former wards of the court regardless of age. I plan on taking full advantage of this and I think this should be the standard across all provinces. I have stagnated in the same industry for years and have hit a ceiling. If I ever want to retire and leave something behind for my girls I need something more. And education is where I'll start. 


Secondly, if I am to be successful with my schooling I need to get my head in order. Because of my CIAD I can't take antidepressants, so all my mental health issues I tackle on my own. And frankly depression is winning. I could fly out to BC and be there 12hrs from now, but I will end up being the same man. 

However, the man that can jump on a bike and pedal his ass all the way to Vancouver Island, that man can do anything. He can regain control of his mental health, he can regain his physical health and he can dedicate a healthy body and mind to his schooling. 

So I want to try and bring some awareness to the mental health struggles and the ward of the court funding thing. 


It's been over two weeks since I've left and there's been some hard dark moments, but there's been some empowering ones too. I'm already down about 20lbs, there's strength in my legs and back ive not felt since I was a teenager, I'm about to cross into a new province and I thought it was worth sharing with this community. 

I have already been posting in another subreddit since I started and they've all been so amazing. 

I have been posting almost daily updates to my insta and tiktok but if I understand correctly I can't link them here on this subreddit? I also have a blog I've been writing when I have time. 

Both the blog and videos are not a magical Xmas land type of upbeat energetic thing. I talk about and show both the ups and downs of mental health and this monumental challenge I've taken on. 


I hope there's a few of you who might pass me on your drives, don't hesitate giving me a honk or a wave. I'll be the big fat guy on a mountain bike :)
